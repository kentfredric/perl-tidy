Perltidy test files
-------------------

This directory is a junkyard of perl snippets which have been useful
during the development of perltidy, but which are probably not of
interest to the average user.  The comments in perltidy make reference
to a few of them.  Some of them are designed to produce error messages
and to illustrate current formatting problems and bugs.  Others were
the subject of study during development.
