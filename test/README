Perltidy test files
-------------------

These files are code snippets which have been useful during the
development of perltidy, but which are probably not of interest to the
average user.  The comments in perltidy make reference to a few of them.
Many of them are designed to produce error messages and to illustrate
current formatting problems and bugs.
