.IX Title "PERLTIDY 1"
.TH PERLTIDY 1 "2002-02-19" "perl v5.6.1" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.UC
.SH "NAME"
perltidy \- a perl script indenter and reformatter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 5
\&    perltidy [ options ] file1 file2 file3 ...
\&            (output goes to file1.tdy, file2.tdy, file3.tdy, ...)
\&    perltidy [ options ] file1 -o outfile
\&    perltidy [ options ] file1 -st >outfile
\&    perltidy [ options ] <infile >outfile
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Perltidy reads a perl script and writes an indented, reformatted script.
.PP
Many users will find enough information in \*(L"\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\*(R" to get 
started.  New users may benefit from the short tutorial which
comes with the distribution.
.PP
Perltidy can produce output on either of two modes, depending on the
existance of an \fB\-html\fR flag.  Without this flag, the output is passed
through a formatter.  The default formatting tries to follow the
recommendations in \fIperlstyle\fR\|(1), but it can be controlled in detail with
numerous input parameters, which are described in \*(L"\s-1FORMATTING\s0 \s-1OPTIONS\s0\*(R".  
.PP
When the \fB\-html\fR flag is given, the output is passed through an \s-1HTML\s0
formatter which is described in \*(L"\s-1HTML\s0 \s-1OPTIONS\s0\*(R".  
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy somefile.pl
.Ve
This will produce a file \fIsomefile.pl.tdy\fR containing the script reformatted
using the default options, which approximate the style suggested in 
\&\fIperlstyle\fR\|(1).  Perltidy never changes the input file.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy *.pl
.Ve
Execute perltidy on all \fI.pl\fR files in the current directory with the
default options.  The output will be in files with an appended \fI.tdy\fR
extension.  For any file with an error, there will be a file with extension
\&\fI.ERR\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -gnu somefile.pl
.Ve
Execute perltidy on file \fIsomefile.pl\fR with a style which approximates the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Coding Standards for C programs.  The output will be \fIsomefile.pl.tdy\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -i=3 somefile.pl
.Ve
Execute perltidy on file \fIsomefile.pl\fR, with 3 columns for each level of
indentation (\fB\-i=3\fR) instead of the default 4 columns.  There will not be any
tabs in the reformatted script, except for any which already exist in comments,
pod documents, quotes, and here documents.  Output will be \fIsomefile.pl.tdy\fR. 
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -i=3 -et=8 somefile.pl
.Ve
Same as the previous example, except that leading whitespace will
be entabbed with one tab character per 8 spaces.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -ce -l=72 somefile.pl
.Ve
Execute perltidy on file \fIsomefile.pl\fR with all defaults except use \*(L"cuddled
elses\*(R" (\fB\-ce\fR) and a maximum line length of 72 columns (\fB\-l=72\fR) instead of
the default 80 columns.  
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -g somefile.pl
.Ve
Execute perltidy on file \fIsomefile.pl\fR and save a log file \fIsomefile.pl.LOG\fR
which shows the nesting of braces, parentheses, and square brackets at
the start of every line.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -html somefile.pl
.Ve
This will produce a file \fIsomefile.pl.html\fR containing the script with
html markup.  The output file will contain an embedded style sheet in
the <\s-1HEAD\s0> section which may be edited to change the appearance.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -html -css=mystyle.css somefile.pl
.Ve
This will produce a file \fIsomefile.pl.html\fR containing the script with
html markup.  This output file will contain a link to a separate style
sheet file \fImystyle.css\fR.  If the file \fImystyle.css\fR does not exist,
it will be created.  If it exists, it will not be overwritten.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -html -pre somefile.pl
.Ve
Write an html snippet with only the \s-1PRE\s0 section to \fIsomefile.pl.html\fR.
This is useful when code snippets are being formatted for inclusion in a
larger web page.  No style sheet will be written in this case.  
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -html -ss >mystyle.css
.Ve
Write a style sheet to \fImystyle.css\fR and exit.
.SH "OPTIONS \- OVERVIEW"
.IX Header "OPTIONS - OVERVIEW"
The entire command line is scanned for options, and they are processed
before any files are processed.  As a result, it does not matter
whether flags are before or after any filenames.  However, the relative
order of parameters is important, with later parameters overriding the
values of earlier parameters.
.PP
For each parameter, there is a long name and a short name.  The short
names are convenient for keyboard input, while the long names are
self-documenting and therefore useful in scripts.  It is customary to
use two leading dashes for long names, but one may be used.
.PP
Most parameters which serve as on/off flags can be negated with a
leading \*(L"n\*(R" (for the short name) or a leading \*(L"no\*(R" (for the long
name).  For example, the flag to have perl check syntax using <perl \-c>
is \fB\-syn\fR or \fB\-\-check\-syntax\fR.  The flag to skip this is
\&\fB\-nsyn\fR or \fB\-\-nocheck\-syntax\fR.
.PP
Options may not be bundled together.  In other words, options \fB\-q\fR and
\&\fB\-g\fR may \s-1NOT\s0 be entered as \fB\-qg\fR.
.PP
Option names may be terminated early as long as they are uniquely identified.
For example, instead of \fB\-dump\-token\-types\fR, it would be sufficient to enter
\&\fB\-dump\-tok\fR, or even \fB\-dump\-t\fR, to uniquely identify this command.
.Sh "I/O control"
.IX Subsection "I/O control"
The following parameters concern the files which are read and written.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR,    \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h,    --help"
Show summary of usage and exit.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR=filename,    \fB\-\-outfile\fR=filename" 4
.IX Item "-o=filename,    --outfile=filename"
Name of the output file (only if a single input file is being
processed).  If no output file is specified, and output is not
redirected to the standard output, the output will go to \fIfilename.tdy\fR.
.IP "\fB\-st\fR,    \fB\-\-standard\-output\fR" 4
.IX Item "-st,    --standard-output"
Perltidy must be able to operate on an arbitrarily large number of files
in a single run, with each output being directed to a different output
file.  Obviously this would conflict with outputting to the single
standard output device, so a special flag, \fB\-st\fR, is required to
request outputting to the standard output.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy somefile.pl -st >somefile.new.pl
.Ve
This option may only be used if there is just a single input file.  When
this option is used, perltidy will have to create a temporary copy of
the output file to feed to perl for syntax checking,
unless allow syntax checking is disabled.  This file will be deleted
when the job finishes.  The default is \fB\-nst\fR or \fB\-nostandard\-output\fR.
.IP "\fB\-oext\fR=ext,    \fB\-\-output\-file\-extension\fR=ext" 4
.IX Item "-oext=ext,    --output-file-extension=ext"
Change the extension of the output file to be \fI.ext\fR instead of the
default \fI.tdy\fR.  If the \fB\-html\fR option is used, this will change
the extension to be \fI.ext\fR instead of the default \fI.html\fR.
.IP "\fB\-opath\fR=path,    \fB\-\-output\-path\fR=path" 4
.IX Item "-opath=path,    --output-path=path"
When perltidy creates a filename for an output file, by default it merely
appends an extension to the path and basename of the input file.  This
parameter causes the path to be changed to \fIpath\fR instead.
.Sp
The path should end in a valid path separator character, but perltidy will try
to add one if it is missing.
.Sp
For example
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& perltidy somefile.pl -opath=/tmp/
.Ve
will produce \fI/tmp/somefile.pl.tdy\fR.  Otherwise, \fIsomefile.pl.tdy\fR will
appear in whatever directory contains \fIsomefile.pl\fR.
.Sp
If the path contains spaces, it should be placed in quotes.
.Sp
This parameter will be ignored if output is being directed to standard output,
or if it is being specified explicitly with the \fB\-o=s\fR parameter.
.IP "\fB\-se\fR,    \fB\-\-standard\-error\-output\fR" 4
.IX Item "-se,    --standard-error-output"
If perltidy detects an error when processing file \fIsomefile.pl\fR, its
default behavior is to write error messages to file \fIsomefile.pl.ERR\fR.
Use \fB\-se\fR to cause all error messages to be sent to the standard error
output stream instead.  This directive may be negated with \fB\-nse\fR. 
Thus, you may place \fB\-se\fR in a \fI.perltidyrc\fR and override it
when desired with \fB\-nse\fR on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR,    \fB\-\-warning\-output\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w,    --warning-output"
Setting \fB\-w\fR causes perltidy to include any non-critical warning
messages be reported as errors.  These include messages
about possible pod problems, possibly bad starting indentation level,
and cautions about indirect object usage.  The default, \fB\-nw\fR or
\&\fB\-\-nowarning\-output\fR, is not to include these warnings.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR,    \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q,    --quiet"
Deactivate error messages and syntax checking (for running under
an editor). 
.Sp
For example, if you use a vi-style editor, such as vim, you may execute
perltidy as a filter from within the editor using something like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& :n1,n2!perltidy -q
.Ve
where \f(CW\*(C`n1,n2\*(C'\fR represents the selected text.  Without the \fB\-q\fR flag,
any error messages will mess up your screen.  Besides, it is common to
run perltidy on incomplete blocks from an editor, and you don't want to
see any complaints about that.  (Or maybe you do; in that case, be
prepared to use your \*(L"undo\*(R" key).
.IP "\fB\-log\fR,    \fB\-\-logfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-log,    --logfile"
Save the \fI.LOG\fR file, which has many useful diagnostics.  Perltidy always
creates a \fI.LOG\fR file, but by default it is deleted unless a program bug is
suspected.  Setting the \fB\-log\fR flag forces the log file to be saved.
.IP "\fB\-g=n\fR, \fB\-\-logfile\-gap=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g=n, --logfile-gap=n"
Set maximum interval between input code lines in the logfile.  This purpose of
this flag is to assist in debugging nesting errors.  The value of \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is
optional.  If you set the flag \fB\-g\fR without the value of \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR, it will be
taken to be 1, meaning that every line will be written to the log file.  This
can be helpful if you are looking for a brace, paren, or bracket nesting error. 
.Sp
Setting \fB\-g\fR also causes the logfile to be saved, so it is not necessary to
also include \fB\-log\fR. 
.Sp
If no \fB\-g\fR flag is given, a value of 50 will be used, meaning that at least
every 50th line will be recorded in the logfile.  This helps prevent
excessively long log files.  
.Sp
Setting a negative value of \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is the same as not setting \fB\-g\fR at all.
.IP "\fB\-npro\fR  \fB\-\-noprofile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-npro  --noprofile"
Ignore any \fI.perltidyrc\fR command file.  Normally, perltidy looks first in
your current directory for a \fI.perltidyrc\fR file of parameters.  (The format
is described below).  If it finds one, it applies those options to the
initial default values, and then it applies any that have been defined
on the command line.  If no \fI.perltidyrc\fR file is found, it looks for one
in your home directory.
.Sp
If you set the \fB\-npro\fR flag, perltidy will not look for this file.
.IP "\fB\-pro=filename\fR or  \fB\-\-profile=filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pro=filename or  --profile=filename"
To simplify testing and switching .perltidyrc files, this command may be
used to specify a configuration file which will override the default
name of .perltidyrc.  There must not be a space on either side of the
\&'=' sign.  For example, the line
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   perltidy -pro=testcfg
.Ve
would cause file \fItestcfg\fR to be used instead of the 
default \fI.perltidyrc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-opt\fR,   \fB\-\-show\-options\fR" 4
.IX Item "-opt,   --show-options"
Write a list of all options used to the \fI.LOG\fR file.  
Please see \fB\-\-dump\-options\fR for a simpler way to do this.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR,   \fB\-\-force\-read\-binary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f,   --force-read-binary"
Force perltidy to process binary files.  To avoid producing excessive
error messages, perltidy skips files identified by the system as non\-text.
However, valid perl scripts containing binary data may sometimes be identified
as non\-text, and this flag forces perltidy to process them.
.SH "FORMATTING OPTIONS"
.IX Header "FORMATTING OPTIONS"
.Sh "Basic Options"
.IX Subsection "Basic Options"
.IP "\fB\-l=n\fR, \fB\-\-maximum\-line\-length=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l=n, --maximum-line-length=n"
The default maximum line length is n=80 characters.  Perltidy will try
to find line break points to keep lines below this length. However, long
quotes and side comments may cause lines to exceed this length. 
Setting \fB\-l=0\fR is equivalent to setting \fB\-l=(a large number)\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-i=n\fR,  \fB\-\-indent\-columns=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i=n,  --indent-columns=n"
Use n columns per indentation level (default n=4).
.IP "tabs" 4
.IX Item "tabs"
Using tab characters will almost certainly lead to future portability
and maintenance problems, so the default and recommendation is not to
use them.  For those who prefer tabs, however, there are two different
options.  
.Sp
Except for possibly introducing tab indentation characters, as outlined
below, Perltidy does not introduce any tab characters into your file,
and it removes any tabs from the code (unless requested not to do so
with \fB\-fws\fR).  If you have any tabs in your comments, quotes, or
here\-documents, they will remain.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-et=n\fR,   \fB\-\-entab\-leading\-whitespace\fR" 4
.IX Item "-et=n,   --entab-leading-whitespace"
This flag causes each \fBn\fR initial space characters to be replaced by
one tab character.  Note that the integer \fBn\fR is completely independent
of the integer specified for indentation parameter, \fB\-i=n\fR.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR,   \fB\-\-tabs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t,   --tabs"
This flag causes one leading tab character to be inserted for each level
of indentation.  Certain other features are incompatible with this
option, and if these options are also given, then a warning message will
be issued and this flag will be unset.  One example is the \fB\-lp\fR
option.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-syn\fR,   \fB\-\-check\-syntax\fR" 4
.IX Item "-syn,   --check-syntax"
The purpose of this flag is to alert you to any situation in which the
intput file has good syntax but the output file has bad syntax, which
implies an error by perltidy.
.Sp
This flag causes perltidy to run \f(CW\*(C`perl \-c \-T\*(C'\fR to check syntax of input
and output.  (To change the flags passed to perl, see the next item,
\&\fB\-pscf\fR).  The results are written to the \fI.LOG\fR file, which will be
saved if an error is detected in the output script.  The output script
is not checked if the input script has a syntax error.  
.Sp
If Perl reports errors in the input file, they will not be reported in
the error output unless the \fB\-warning\-output\fR flag is given. 
.Sp
To skip syntax checking, use \fB\-nsyn\fR or \fB\-\-nocheck\-syntax\fR.  Syntax
checking is also deactivated by the \fB\-\-quiet\fR flag, discussed above.
.Sp
The default is to do a syntax check on most operating systems.  An
exception is Windows 9x/Me systems, which do not handle this well.
Another exception is when the input or output streams are not connected
to identifiable filenames.  In the past, copies of these streams were
saved in temporary files, but this has caused too many portability
problems.
.Sp
\&\fBPlease note:\fR Even if this type of syntax checking is deactivated,
perltidy will still do extensive syntax checking on its own.
.IP "\fB\-pscf=s\fR, \fB\-perl\-syntax\-check\-flags=s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pscf=s, -perl-syntax-check-flags=s"
When perl is invoked to check syntax, the normal flags are \f(CW\*(C`\-c \-T\*(C'\fR.  In
addition, if the \fB\-x\fR flag is given to perltidy, then perl will also be
passed a \fB\-x\fR flag.  It should not normally be necessary to change
these flags, but it can be done with the \fB\-pscf=s\fR flag.  For example,
if the taint flag, \f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR, is not wanted, the flag could be set to be just
\&\fB\-pscf=\-c\fR.  
.Sp
Perltidy will pass your string to perl with the exception that it will
add a \fB\-c\fR and \fB\-x\fR if appropriate.  The \fI.LOG\fR file will show
exactly what flags were passed to perl.
.IP "\fB\-io\fR,   \fB\-\-indent\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-io,   --indent-only"
This flag is used to deactivate all formatting and line break changes.
When it is in effect, the only change to the script will be indentation.
And any flags controlling whitespace and newlines will be ignored.  You
might want to use this if you are perfectly happy with your whitespace
and line breaks, and merely want perltidy to handle the indentation.
(This also speeds up perltidy by well over a factor of two, so it might be
useful when perltidy is merely being used to help find a brace error in
a large script).
.Sp
Setting this flag is equivalent to setting \fB\-\-freeze\-newlines\fR and
\&\fB\-\-freeze\-whitespace\fR.
.Sh "Code Indentation Control"
.IX Subsection "Code Indentation Control"
.IP "\fB\-ci=n\fR, \fB\-\-continuation\-indentation=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ci=n, --continuation-indentation=n"
Continuation indentation is extra indentation spaces applied when
a long line is broken.  The default is n=2, illustrated here:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my $level =   # -ci=2      
\&   ( $max_index_to_go >= 0 ) ? $levels_to_go[0] : $last_output_level;
.Ve
The same example, with n=0, is a little harder to read:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& my $level =   # -ci=0    
\& ( $max_index_to_go >= 0 ) ? $levels_to_go[0] : $last_output_level;
.Ve
The value given to \fB\-ci\fR is also used by some commands when a small
space is required.  Examples are commands for outdenting labels,
\&\fB\-ola\fR, and control keywords, \fB\-ock\fR.  
.Sp
When default values are not used, it is suggested that the value \fBn\fR
given with \fB\-ci=n\fR be no more than about one-half of the number of
spaces assigned to a full indentation level on the \fB\-i=n\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-sil=n\fR \fB\-\-starting\-indentation\-level=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sil=n --starting-indentation-level=n"
By default, perltidy examines the input file and tries to determine the
starting indentation level.  While it is often zero, it may not be
zero for a code snippet being sent from an editing session.  If the
default method does not work correctly, or you want to change the
starting level, use \fB\-sil=n\fR, to force the starting level to be n.
.IP "List indentation using \fB\-lp\fR, \fB\-\-line\-up\-parentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "List indentation using -lp, --line-up-parentheses"
By default, perltidy indents lists with 4 spaces, or whatever value
is specified with \fB\-i=n\fR.  Here is a small list formatted in this way:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @month_of_year = (
\&        'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',
\&        'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'
\&    );
.Ve
Use the \fB\-lp\fR flag to add extra indentation to cause the data to begin
past the opening parentheses of a sub call or list, or opening square
bracket of an anonymous array, or opening curly brace of an anonymous
hash.  With this option set, the above list would become:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    @month_of_year = (
\&                       'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',
\&                       'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'
\&    );
.Ve
If the available line length (see \fB\-l=n\fR ) does not permit this much 
space, perltidy will use less.  
.Sp
This option has no effect on code \s-1BLOCKS\s0, such as if/then/else blocks,
which always use whatever is specified with \fB\-i=n\fR.  Also, the
existence of line breaks and/or block comments between the opening and
closing parens may cause perltidy to temporarily revert to its default
method.
.Sp
Note: The \fB\-lp\fR option may not be used together with the \fB\-t\fR tabs option.
It may, however, be used with the \fB\-et=n\fR tab method.
.Sp
In addition, any parameter which restricts the ability of perltidy to
choose newlines will all conflict with \fB\-lp\fR and will cause \fB\-lp\fR to
be deactivated.  These include 
\&\fB\-io\fR, \fB\-fnl\fR, \fB\-nanl\fR, and \fB\-ndnl\fR.
.IP "\fB\-icp\fR, \fB\-\-indent\-closing\-paren\fR" 4
.IX Item "-icp, --indent-closing-paren"
The \fB\-icp\fR option leaves a list-termination line of the form \f(CW\*(C`);\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`};\*(C'\fR,
or \f(CW\*(C`];\*(C'\fR indented with the same indentation as the previous line.  The
previous example with \fB\-icp\fR would give,
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    # perltidy -icp:
\&    @month_of_year = (
\&        'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun',
\&        'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'
\&        );
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-icb\fR, \fB\-\-indent\-closing\-brace\fR" 4
.IX Item "-icb, --indent-closing-brace"
The \fB\-icb\fR option leaves a brace which terminates a code block 
indented with the same indentation as the previous line.  For example,
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        if ($task) {
\&            yyy();
\&            }    # -icb
\&        else {
\&            zzz();
\&            }
.Ve
The default is not to do this, indicated by \fB\-nicb\fR.
.IP "\fB\-olq\fR, \fB\-\-outdent\-long\-quotes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-olq, --outdent-long-quotes"
When \fB\-olq\fR is set, lines which is a quoted string longer than the
value \fBmaximum-line-length\fR will have their indentation removed to make
them more readable.  This is the default.  To prevent such out\-denting,
use \fB\-nolq\fR or \fB\-\-nooutdent\-long\-lines\fR.
.IP "\fB\-oll\fR, \fB\-\-outdent\-long\-lines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-oll, --outdent-long-lines"
This command is equivalent to \fB\-\-outdent\-long\-quotes\fR and
\&\fB\-\-outdent\-long\-comments\fR, and it is included for compatibility with previous
versions of perltidy.  The negation of this also works, \fB\-noll\fR or
\&\fB\-\-nooutdent\-long\-lines\fR, and is equivalent to setting \fB\-nolq\fR and \fB\-nolc\fR.
.IP "Outdenting Labels: \fB\-ola\fR,  \fB\-\-outdent\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "Outdenting Labels: -ola,  --outdent-labels"
This command will cause labels to be outdented by 2 spaces (or whatever
\&\fB\-ci\fR has been set to), if possible.  For example, with \fBperltidy \-ola\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        my $i;
\&      LOOP: while ( $i = <FOTOS> ) {
\&            chomp($i);
\&            next unless $i;
\&            fixit($i);
\&        }
.Ve
Labels which are already at the leftmost column will not be affected by
this command.  Use \fB\-nola\fR to not outdent labels.  The current
default is not to outdent labels.
.IP "Outdenting Keywords" 4
.IX Item "Outdenting Keywords"
.RS 4
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-okw\fR,  \fB\-\-outdent\-keywords\fR" 4
.IX Item "-okw,  --outdent-keywords"
.PD
The command \fB\-okw\fR will will cause certain leading control keywords to
be outdented by 2 spaces (or whatever \fB\-ci\fR has been set to), if
possible.  By default, these keywords are \f(CW\*(C`redo\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`next\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`last\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR.  The intention is to make these control keywords
easier to see.  To change this list of keywords being outdented, see
the next section.
.Sp
For example, using \f(CW\*(C`perltidy \-ock\*(C'\fR on the previous example gives:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        my $i;
\&        LOOP: while ( $i = <FOTOS> ) {
\&            chomp($i);
\&          next unless $i;
\&            fixit($i);
\&        }
.Ve
The default is not to do this.  
.IP "Specifying Outdented Keywords: \fB\-okwl=string\fR,  \fB\-\-outdent\-keyword\-list=string\fR" 4
.IX Item "Specifying Outdented Keywords: -okwl=string,  --outdent-keyword-list=string"
This command can be used to change the keywords which are outdented with
the \fB\-okw\fR command.  The parameter \fBstring\fR is a required list of perl
keywords, which should be placed in quotes if there are more than one.
By itself, it does not cause any outdenting to occur, so the \fB\-okw\fR
command is still required.
.Sp
For example, the commands \f(CW\*(C`\-okwl="next last redo goto" \-okw\*(C'\fR will cause
those four keywords to be outdented.  It is probably simplest to place
any \fB\-okwl\fR command in a \fI.perltidyrc\fR file.

Whitespace refers to the blank space between variables, operators,
and other code tokens.
.IP "\fB\-fws\fR,  \fB\-\-freeze\-whitespace\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fws,  --freeze-whitespace"
This flag causes your original whitespace to remain unchanged, and
causes the rest of the whitespace commands in this section, the
Code Indentation section, and
the Comment Control section to be ignored.
.IP "Tightness of curly braces, parentheses, and square brackets." 4
.IX Item "Tightness of curly braces, parentheses, and square brackets."
Here the term \*(L"tightness\*(R" will mean the closeness with which
pairs of enclosing tokens, such as parentheses, contain the quantities
within.  A numerical value of 0, 1, or 2 defines the tightness, with
0 being least tight and 2 being most tight.  Spaces within containers
are always symmetric, so if there is a space after a \f(CW\*(C`(\*(C'\fR then there
will be a space before the corresponding \f(CW\*(C`)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-pt=n\fR or \fB\-\-paren\-tightness\fR parameter controls the space within
parens.  The example below shows the effect of the three possible
values, 0, 1, and 2:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& if ( ( my $len_tab = length( $tabstr ) ) > 0 ) {  # -pt=0
\& if ( ( my $len_tab = length($tabstr) ) > 0 ) {    # -pt=1 (default)
\& if ((my $len_tab = length($tabstr)) > 0) {        # -pt=2
.Ve
When n is 0, there is always a space to the right of a '(' and to the left
of a ')'.  For n=2 there is never a space.  For n=1, the default, there
is a space unless the quantity within the parens is a single token, such
as an identifier or quoted string.  
.Sp
Likewise, the parameter \fB\-sbt=n\fR or \fB\-\-square\-bracket\-tightness\fR
controls the space within square brackets, as illustrated below.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& $width = $col[ $j + $k ] - $col[ $j ];  # -sbt=0
\& $width = $col[ $j + $k ] - $col[$j];    # -sbt=1 (default)
\& $width = $col[$j + $k] - $col[$j];      # -sbt=2
.Ve
Curly braces which do not contain code blocks are controlled by
the parameter \fB\-bt=n\fR or \fB\-\-brace\-tightness=n\fR. 
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& $obj->{ $parsed_sql->{ 'table' }[0] };    # -bt=0
\& $obj->{ $parsed_sql->{'table'}[0] };      # -bt=1 (default)
\& $obj->{$parsed_sql->{'table'}[0]};        # -bt=2
.Ve
And finally, curly braces which contain blocks of code are controlled by the
parameter \fB\-bbt=n\fR or \fB\-\-block\-brace\-tightness=n\fR as illustrated in the
example below.   
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& %bf = map { $_ => -M $_ } grep { /\e.deb$/ } dirents '.'; # -bbt=0 (default)
\& %bf = map { $_ => -M $_ } grep {/\e.deb$/} dirents '.';   # -bbt=1

Semicolons within \fBfor\fR loops may sometimes be hard to see,
particularly when commas are also present.  This option places spaces on
both sides of these special semicolons, and is the default.  Use
\&\fB\-nsfs\fR or \fB\-\-nospace\-for\-semicolon\fR to deactivate it.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& for ( @a = @$ap, $u = shift @a ; @a ; $u = $v ) {  # -sfs (default)

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-asc\fR,  \fB\-\-add\-semicolons\fR" 4
.IX Item "-asc,  --add-semicolons"
Setting \fB\-asc\fR allows perltidy to add any missing optional semicolon at the end 
of a line which is followed by a closing curly brace on the next line.  This
is the default, and may be deactivated with \fB\-nasc\fR or \fB\-\-noadd\-semicolons\fR.
.IP "\fB\-dsm\fR,  \fB\-\-delete\-semicolons\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dsm,  --delete-semicolons"
Setting \fB\-dsm\fR allows perltidy to delete extra semicolons which are
simply empty statements.  This is the default, and may be deactivated
with \fB\-ndsm\fR or \fB\-\-nodelete\-semicolons\fR.  (Such semicolons are not
deleted, however, if they would promote a side comment to a block
comment).
.IP "\fB\-aws\fR,  \fB\-\-add\-whitespace\fR" 4
.IX Item "-aws,  --add-whitespace"
Setting this option allows perltidy to add certain whitespace improve
code readability.  This is the default. If you do not want any
whitespace added, but are willing to have some whitespace deleted, use
\&\fB\-naws\fR.  (Use \fB\-fws\fR to leave whitespace completely unchanged).
.IP "\fB\-dws\fR,  \fB\-\-delete\-old\-whitespace\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dws,  --delete-old-whitespace"
Setting this option allows perltidy to remove some old whitespace
between characters, if necessary.  This is the default.  If you
do not want any old whitespace removed, use \fB\-ndws\fR or
\&\fB\-\-nodelete\-old\-whitespace\fR.
.IP "Detailed whitespace controls" 4
.IX Item "Detailed whitespace controls"
For those who want more detailed control over the whitespace around
tokens, there are four parameters which can directly modify the default
whitespace rules built into perltidy for any token.  They are:
.Sp
\&\fB\-wls=s\fR or \fB\-\-want\-left\-space=s\fR,
.Sp
\&\fB\-nwls=s\fR or \fB\-\-nowant\-left\-space=s\fR,
.Sp
\&\fB\-wrs=s\fR or \fB\-\-want\-right\-space=s\fR,
.Sp
\&\fB\-nwrs=s\fR or \fB\-\-nowant\-right\-space=s\fR.
.Sp
These parameters are each followed by a quoted string, \fBs\fR, containing a
list of token types.  No more than one of each of these parameters
should be specified, because repeating a command-line parameter
always overwrites the previous one before perltidy ever sees it.
.Sp
To illustrate how these are used, suppose it is desired that there be no
space on either side of the token types \fB= + \- / *\fR.  The following two
parameters would specify this desire:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  -nwls="= + - / *"    -nwrs="= + - / *"
.Ve
(Note that the token types are in quotes, and that they are separated by
spaces).  With these modified whitespace rules, the following line of math:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $root = -$b + sqrt( $b * $b - 4. * $a * $c ) / ( 2. * $a );
.Ve
becomes this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $root=-$b+sqrt( $b*$b-4.*$a*$c )/( 2.*$a );
.Ve
These parameters should be considered to be hints to perltidy rather
than fixed rules, because perltidy must try to resolve conflicts that
arise between them and all of the other rules that it uses.  One
conflict that can arise is if, between two tokens, the left token wants
a space and the right one doesn't.  In this case, the token not wanting
a space takes priority.  
.Sp
It is necessary to have a list of all token types in order to create
this type of input.  Such a list can be obtained by the command
\&\fB\-dump\-token\-types\fR.

.Sp
\&\fB\-ntqw\fR or \fB\-\-notrim\-qw\fR cause leading and trailing whitespace around
multi-line \f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR quotes to be left unchanged.  This option will not
normally be necessary, but was added for testing purposes, because in
some versions of perl, trimming \f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR quotes changes the syntax tree.
.Sh "Comment Controls"
.IX Subsection "Comment Controls"
Perltidy has a number of ways to control the appearance of both block comments
and side comments.  The term \fBblock comment\fR here refers to a full-line
comment, whereas \fBside comment\fR will refer to a comment which appears on a
line to the right of some code.
.IP "\fB\-ibc\fR,  \fB\-\-indent\-block\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ibc,  --indent-block-comments"
Block comments normally look best when they are indented to the same
level as the code which follows them.  This is the default behavior, but
you may use \fB\-nibc\fR to keep block comments left\-justified.  Here is an
example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&             # this comment is indented      (-ibc, default)
\&             if ($task) { yyy(); }
.Ve
The alternative is \fB\-nibc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& # this comment is not indented              (-nibc)
\&             if ($task) { yyy(); }
.Ve
See also \fB\-sbc\fR for a way to have some indented and some outdented
block comments.
.IP "\fB\-olc\fR, \fB\-\-outdent\-long\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-olc, --outdent-long-comments"
When \fB\-olc\fR is set, lines which are full-line (block) comments longer
than the value \fBmaximum-line-length\fR will have their indentation
removed.  The default is not to do this.  
.IP "\fB\-msc=n\fR,  \fB\-\-minimum\-space\-to\-comment=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msc=n,  --minimum-space-to-comment=n"
Side comments look best when lined up several spaces to the right of
code.  Perltidy will try to keep comments at least n spaces to the
right.  The default is n=4 spaces.
.IP "\fB\-hsc\fR, \fB\-\-hanging\-side\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-hsc, --hanging-side-comments"
By default, perltidy tries to identify and align \*(L"hanging side
comments\*(R", which are something like this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        my $IGNORE = 0;    # This is a side comment
\&                           # This is a hanging side comment
\&                           # And so is this
.Ve
A comment is considered to be a hanging side comment if (1) it immediately
follows a line with a side comment, or another hanging side comment, and
(2) there is some leading whitespace on the line.
To deactivate this feature, use \fB\-nhsc\fR or \fB\-\-nohanging\-side\-comments\fR.  
If block comments are preceded by a blank line, or have no leading
whitespace, they will not be mistaken as hanging side comments.
.IP "Closing Side Comments" 4
.IX Item "Closing Side Comments"
A closing side comment is a special comment which perltidy can
automatically create and place after the closing brace of a code block.
They can be useful for code maintenance and debugging.  The command
\&\fB\-csc\fR (or \fB\-closing\-side\-comments\fR) adds or updates closing side
comments.  For example, here is a small code snippet
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        sub foo {
\&            if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) {
\&                print("Hello, World\en");
\&            }
\&            else {
\&                print( $_[0], "\en" );
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
And here is the result of processing with \f(CW\*(C`perltidy \-csc\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        sub foo {
\&            if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) {
\&                print("Hello, World\en");
\&            }
\&            else {
\&                print( $_[0], "\en" );
\&            }
\&        } ## end sub foo
.Ve
A closing side comment was added for \f(CW\*(C`sub foo\*(C'\fR in this case, but not
for the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR blocks, because they were below the 6 line
cutoff limit for adding closing side comments.  This limit may be
changed with the \fB\-csci\fR command, described below.
.Sp
The command \fB\-dcsc\fR (or \fB\-\-delete\-closing\-side\-comments\fR) reverses this 
process and removes these comments.
.Sp
Several commands are available to modify the behavior of these two basic
commands, \fB\-csc\fR and \fB\-dcsc\fR:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-csci=n\fR, or \fB\-closing\-side\-comment\-interval=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-csci=n, or -closing-side-comment-interval=n"
where \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR is the minimum number of lines that a block must have in
order for a closing side comment to be added.  The default value is
\&\f(CW\*(C`n=6\*(C'\fR.  To illustrate, here is the above block processed with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-csci=2 \-csc\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        sub foo {
\&            if ( !defined( $_[0] ) ) {
\&                print("Hello, World\en");
\&            } ## end if ( !defined( $_[0] )...
\&            else {
\&                print( $_[0], "\en" );
\&            } ## end else
\&        } ## end sub foo
.Ve
Now the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR blocks are commented.  However, now this has
become very cluttered.
.IP "\fB\-cscp=string\fR, or \fB\-closing\-side\-comment\-prefix=string\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cscp=string, or -closing-side-comment-prefix=string"
where string is the prefix used before the name of the block type.  The
default prefix, shown above, is \f(CW\*(C`## end\*(C'\fR.  This string will be added to
closing side comments, and it will also be used to recognize them in
order to update, delete, and format them.  Any comment identified as a
closing side comment will be placed just a single space to the right of
its closing brace.
.IP "\fB\-cscl=string\fR, or \fB\-closing\-side\-comment\-list\-string\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cscl=string, or -closing-side-comment-list-string"
where \f(CW\*(C`string\*(C'\fR is a list of block types to be tagged with closing side
comments.  By default, all code block types preceded by a keyword or
label (such as \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR, and so on) will be tagged.  The \fB\-cscl\fR
command changes the default list to be any selected block types.  To
request that a block with a label be included, include a bare colon,
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR, in the list of block types.  For example, the following command
requests that only \f(CW\*(C`sub\*(C'\fR's, labels, \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR blocks be
affected by any \fB\-csc\fR or \fB\-dcsc\fR operation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   -cscl="sub : BEGIN END"
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-csct=n\fR, or \fB\-closing\-side\-comment\-maximum\-text=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-csct=n, or -closing-side-comment-maximum-text=n"
The text appended to certain block types, such as an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR block, is
whatever lies between the keyword introducing the block, such as \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR,
and the opening brace.  Since this might be too much text for a side
comment, there needs to be a limit, and that is the purpose of this
parameter.  The default value is \f(CW\*(C`n=20\*(C'\fR, meaning that no additional
tokens will be appended to this text after its length reaches 20
characters.  Omitted text is indicated with \f(CW...\fR.  (Tokens, including
sub names, are never truncated, however, so actual lengths may exceed
this).  To illustrate, in the above example, the appended text of the
first block is \f(CW\*(C` ( !defined( $_[0] )...\*(C'\fR.  The existing limit of
\&\f(CW\*(C`n=20\*(C'\fR caused this text to be truncated, as indicated by the \f(CW...\fR.
.IP "\fB\-cscw\fR, or \fB\-closing\-side\-comment\-warnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cscw, or -closing-side-comment-warnings"
This parameter is intended to help make the initial transition to the use of
closing side comments.  It will help prevent the loss of any existing side
comment which happens to have the closing side comment prefix.  It causes two
things to happen if a closing side comment replaces an existing, different
closing side comment:  first, an error message will be issued, and second, the
original side comment will be placed alone on a new specially marked comment
line for later attention.

if used, merely modify the behavior of these two commands.  
.IP "\(bu" 4
It is recommended that the \fB\-cscw\fR flag be used along with \fB\-csc\fR on
the first use of perltidy on a given file.  This will prevent loss of
any existing side comment data which happens to have the csc prefix.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Once you use \fB\-csc\fR, you should continue to use it so that any
closing side comments remain correct as code changes.  Otherwise, these
comments will become incorrect as the code is updated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you edit the closing side comments generated by perltidy, you must also
change the prefix to be different from the closing side comment prefix.
Otherwise, your edits will be lost when you rerun perltidy with \fB\-csc\fR.   For
example, you could simply change \f(CW\*(C`## end\*(C'\fR to be \f(CW\*(C`## End\*(C'\fR, since the test is
case sensitive.  You may also want to use the \fB\-ssc\fR flag to keep these
modified closing side comments spaced the same as actual closing side comments.

Static block comments are block comments with a special leading pattern,
\&\f(CW\*(C`##\*(C'\fR by default, which will be treated slightly differently from other
block comments.  They effectively behave as if they had glue along their
left and top edges, because they stick to the left edge and previous line
when there is no blank spaces in those places.  This option is
particularly useful for controlling how commented code is displayed.

Two command line parameters provide some control over whether

\&\fB\-wba=s\fR or \fB\-\-want\-break\-after=s\fR, and
.Sp
\&\fB\-wbb=s\fR or \fB\-\-want\-break\-before=s\fR.
.Sp
These parameters are each followed by a quoted string, \fBs\fR, containing
a list of token types (separated only by spaces).  No more than one of each
of these parameters should be specified, because repeating a
command-line parameter always overwrites the previous one before
perltidy ever sees it.
.Sp
By default, perltidy breaks \fBafter\fR these token types:
  % + \- * / x != == >= <= =~ !~ < >  | & >= <
  = **= += *= &= <<= &&= \-= /= |= >>= ||= .= %= ^= x=
.Sp
And perltidy breaks \fBbefore\fR these token types by default:
  . << >> \-> && ||
.Sp
To illustrate, to cause a break after a concatenation operator, \f(CW'.'\fR,
rather than before it, the command line would be
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  -wba="."
.Ve
As another example, the following command would cause a break before 
math operators \f(CW'+'\fR, \f(CW'\-'\fR, \f(CW'/'\fR, and \f(CW'*'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  -wbb="+ - / *"
.Ve
These commands should work well for most of the token types that
perltidy uses (use \fB\-\-dump\-token\-types\fR for a list).  However, for a
few token types there may be conflicts with hardwired logic which cause
unexpected results.  One example is curly braces, which should be
controlled with the parameter \fBbl\fR provided for that purpose.

If you use perltidy frequently, you probably won't be happy until you
create a \fI.perltidyrc\fR file to avoid typing commonly-used parameters.
Perltidy will first look in your current directory for a command file
named \fI.perltidyrc\fR.  If it does not find one, it will continue looking
for one in other standard locations.  
.Sp
These other locations are system\-dependent, and may be displayed with
the command \f(CW\*(C`perltidy \-dpro\*(C'\fR.  Under Unix systems, it will look for a
\&\fI.perltidyrc\fR file in the home directory, and then for a system-wide
file \fI/usr/local/etc/perltidyrc\fR, and then it will look for
\&\fI/etc/perltidyrc\fR.  Note that these last two system-wide files do not
have a leading dot.  Further system-dependent information will be found
in the \s-1INSTALL\s0 file distributed with perltidy.
.Sp
This file is free format, and simply a list of parameters, just as they
would be entered on a command line.  Any number of lines may be used,
with any number of parameters per line, although it may be easiest to
read with one parameter per line.  Blank lines are ignored, and text
after a '#' is ignored to the end of a line.

\&  -pt=0  # parens not tight at all
\&  -bt=0  # braces not tight
\&  -sbt=0 # square brackets not tight
.Ve
The parameters in the \fI.perltidyrc\fR file are installed first, so any
parameters given on the command line will have priority over them.  
.Sp
To avoid confusion, perltidy ignores any command in the .perltidyrc
file which would cause some kind of dump and an exit.  These are:
.Sp
.Vb 1

A very helpful command is \fB\-\-dump\-profile\fR or \fB\-dpro\fR.  It writes a
list of all configuration filenames tested to standard output, and

files, and which one if any it selects, just enter 
.Sp
.Vb 1

.IP "Controlling list formatting and vertical alignment" 4
.IX Item "Controlling list formatting and vertical alignment"
Perltidy attempts to place comma-separated arrays of values 
in tables which can be vertically aligned.  The number of
fields is, by default, chosen to be the largest even number which
fits in the current page width (defined by \fB\-l=n\fR).  Usually this
works well.
.Sp
There are two ways to control this formatting.  The first is with the
use of comments or empty lines.  If there are any comments or blank
lines between the opening and closing structural brace, parenthesis, or
bracket containing the list, then the original line breaks will be used
for the entire list instead.
.Sp
The second is with the parameter \fB\-\-mft=n\fR or
\&\fB\-\-maximum\-fields\-per\-table=n\fR.  The default value for \fBn\fR is a large
number, 40.  If the computed number of fields for any table exceeds
\&\fBn\fR, then it will be reduced to \fBn\fR.  While this value should probably
be left unchanged as a general rule, it might be used on a small section
of code to force a list to have a particular number of fields per line,
and then a single comment could be introduced somewhere to freeze the
formatting in future applications of perltidy, like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    # perltidy -mft=2
\&    @month_of_year = (    
\&        'Jan', 'Feb',
\&        'Mar', 'Apr',
\&        'May', 'Jun',
\&        'Jul', 'Aug',
\&        'Sep', 'Oct',
\&        'Nov', 'Dec'
\&    );
.Ve
Vertical alignment refers to lining up similar tokens vertically, like
this:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& my $lines     = 0;    # checksum: #lines
\& my $bytes     = 0;    # checksum: #bytes
\& my $sum       = 0;    # checksum: system V sum
.Ve
Once the perltidy vertical aligner \*(L"locks on\*(R" to a pattern, such as
defined by the \*(L"=\*(R" and \*(L"#\*(R" in the above example, it retains the pattern
for as long as possible.  However, a blank line or full-line comment
will cause it to forget the pattern and start looking for another.
Thus, a single blank line can be introduced to force the aligner to stop
aligning when it is undesirable.
.IP "Making a file unreadable" 4
.IX Item "Making a file unreadable"
The goal of perltidy is to improve the readability of files, but there
are two commands which have the opposite effect, \fB\-\-mangle\fR and
\&\fB\-\-extrude\fR.  They are actually
merely aliases for combinations of other parameters.  Both of these
strip all possible whitespace, but leave comments and pod documents,
so that they are essentially reversible.  The
difference between these is that \fB\-\-mangle\fR puts the fewest possible
line breaks in a script while \fB\-\-extrude\fR puts the maximum possible.
Note that these options do not provided any meaningful obfuscation, because
perltidy can be used to reformat the files.  They were originally
developed to help test the tokenization logic of perltidy, but they
have other uses.
One use for \fB\-\-mangle\fR is the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy --mangle myfile.pl -st | perltidy -o myfile.pl.new
.Ve
This will form the maximum possible number of one-line blocks (see next
section), and can sometimes help clean up a badly formatted script.
.Sp
A similar technique can be used with \fB\-\-extrude\fR instead of \fB\-\-mangle\fR
to make the minimum number of one-line blocks.
.Sp
Another use for \fB\-\-mangle\fR is to combine it with \fB\-dac\fR to reduce
the file size of a perl script.
.IP "One-line blocks" 4
.IX Item "One-line blocks"
There are a few points to note regarding one-line blocks.  A one-line
block is something like this,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        if ($x > 0) { $y = 1 / $x }
.Ve
where the contents within the curly braces is short enough to fit
on a single line.
.Sp
With few exceptions, Perltidy retains existing one-line blocks, if it
is possible within the line-length constraint, but it does not attempt
to form new ones.  In other words, Perltidy will try to follow the
one-line block style of the input file.
.Sp
If an existing one-line block is longer than the maximum line length,
however, it will be broken into multiple lines.  When this happens, perltidy
checks for and adds any optional terminating semicolon (unless the \fB\-nasc\fR
option is used) if the block is a code block.  
.Sp
The main exception is that Perltidy will attempt to form new one-line
blocks following the keywords \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR, because
these code blocks are often small and most clearly displayed in a single
line.
.Sp
Occasionally it is helpful to introduce line breaks in lists containing
a '=>' symbol, which is sometimes called a \*(L"comma\-arrow\*(R".  To force
perltidy to introduce breaks in a one-line block containing comma
arrows, use the \fB\-\-break\-after\-comma\-arrows\fR, or \fB\-baa\fR, flag.  For
example, given the following single line, Perltidy will not add any line
breaks:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    bless { B => $B, Root => $Root } => $package;   -nbaa (default)
.Ve
To introduce breaks to show the structure, use \fB\-baa\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    bless {                                         -baa
\&        B    => $B,
\&        Root => $Root
\&    } => $package;
.Ve
One-line block rules can conflict with the cuddled-else option.  When
the cuddled-else option is used, perltidy retains existing one-line
blocks, even if they do not obey cuddled-else formatting.
.Sp
Occasionally, when one-line blocks get broken because they exceed the
available line length, the formatting will violate the requested brace style.
If this happens, reformatting the script a second time should correct
the problem.
.IP "Debugging" 4
.IX Item "Debugging"
The following flags are available for debugging:
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-defaults\fR or \fB\-ddf\fR will write the default option set to standard output and quit
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-profile\fR or \fB\-dpro\fR  will write the name of the current 
configuration file and its contents to standard output and quit.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-options\fR or \fB\-dop\fR  will write current option set to standard
output and quit.  
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-long\-names\fR or \fB\-dln\fR  will write all command line long names (passed 
to Get_options) to standard output and quit.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-short\-names\fR  or \fB\-dsn\fR will write all command line short names 
to standard output and quit.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-token\-types\fR or \fB\-dtt\fR  will write a list of all token types 
to standard output and quit.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-want\-left\-space\fR or \fB\-dwls\fR  will write the hash \f(CW%want_left_space\fR
to standard output and quit.  See the section on controlling whitespace
around tokens.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-dump\-want\-right\-space\fR or \fB\-dwrs\fR  will write the hash \f(CW%want_right_space\fR
to standard output and quit.  See the section on controlling whitespace
around tokens.
.Sp
\&\fB\-DEBUG\fR  will write a file with extension \fI.DEBUG\fR for each input file 
showing the tokenization of all lines of code.
.IP "Working with MakeMaker, AutoLoader and SelfLoader" 4
.IX Item "Working with MakeMaker, AutoLoader and SelfLoader"
The first \f(CW$VERSION\fR line of a file which might be eval'd by MakeMaker
is passed through unchanged except for indentation.  
Use \fB\-\-nopass\-version\-line\fR, or \fB\-npvl\fR, to deactivate this feature.
.Sp
If the AutoLoader module is used, perltidy will continue formatting
code after seeing an _\|_END_\|_ line.
Use \fB\-\-nolook\-for\-autoloader\fR, or \fB\-nlal\fR, to deactivate this feature.
.Sp
Likewise, if the SelfLoader module is used, perltidy will continue formatting
code after seeing a _\|_DATA_\|_ line.
Use \fB\-\-nolook\-for\-selfloader\fR, or \fB\-nlsl\fR, to deactivate this feature.
.SH "HTML OPTIONS"
.IX Header "HTML OPTIONS"
.IP "The \fB\-html\fR master switch" 4
.IX Item "The -html master switch"
The flag \fB\-html\fR causes perltidy to write an html file with extension
\&\fI.html\fR.  So, for example, the following command
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        perltidy -html somefile.pl
.Ve
will produce a syntax-colored html file named \fIsomefile.pl.html\fR
which may be viewed with a browser.
.Sp
\&\fBPlease Note\fR: In this case, perltidy does not do any formatting to the
input file, and it does not write a formatted file with extension
\&\fI.tdy\fR.  This means that two perltidy runs are required to create a
fully reformatted, html copy of a script.  
.IP "The \fB\-pre\fR flag for code snippets" 4
.IX Item "The -pre flag for code snippets"
When the \fB\-pre\fR flag is given, only the pre-formatted section, within
the <\s-1PRE\s0> and </PRE> tags, will be output.  This simplifies inclusion
of the output in other files.  The default is to output a complete
web page.
.IP "The \fB\-nnn\fR flag for line numbering" 4
.IX Item "The -nnn flag for line numbering"
When the \fB\-nnn\fR flag is given, the output lines will be numbered.
.IP "Style Sheets" 4
.IX Item "Style Sheets"
Style sheets make it very convenient to control and adjust the
appearance of html pages.  The default behavior is to write a page of
html with an embedded style sheet.
.Sp
An alternative to an embedded style sheet is to create a page with a
link to an external style sheet.  This is indicated with the
\&\fB\-css=filename\fR,  where the external style sheet is \fIfilename\fR.  The
external style sheet \fIfilename\fR will be created if and only if it does
not exist.  This option is useful for controlling multiple pages from a
single style sheet.
.Sp
To cause perltidy to write a style sheet to standard output and exit,
use the \fB\-ss\fR, or \fB\-\-stylesheet\fR, flag.  This is useful if the style
sheet could not be written for some reason, such as if the \fB\-pre\fR flag
was used.  Thus, for example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  perltidy -html -ss >mystyle.css
.Ve
will write a style sheet with the default properties to file
\&\fImystyle.css\fR.
.Sp
The use of style sheets is encouraged, but a web page without a style
sheets can be created with the flag \fB\-nss\fR.  Use this option if you
must to be sure that older browsers (roughly speaking, versions prior to
4.0 of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer) can display the
syntax-coloring of the html files.
.IP "Controlling \s-1HTML\s0 properties" 4
.IX Item "Controlling HTML properties"
Syntax colors may be changed from their default values by flags of the either
the long form, \fB\-html\-color\-xxxxxx=n\fR, or more conveniently the short form,
\&\fB\-hcx=n\fR, where \fBxxxxxx\fR is one of the following words, and \fBx\fR is the
corresponding abbreviation:
.Sp

.Ve
A default set of colors has been defined, but they may be changed by providing
values to any of the following parameters, where \fBn\fR is either a 6 digit 
hex \s-1RGB\s0 color value or an ascii name for a color, such as 'red'.
.Sp
To illustrate, the following command will produce an html 
file \fIsomefile.pl.html\fR with \*(L"aqua\*(R" keywords:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        perltidy -html -hck=00ffff somefile.pl
.Ve
and this should be equivalent for most browsers:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        perltidy -html -hck=aqua somefile.pl
.Ve
Perltidy merely writes any non-hex names that it sees in the html file.
The following 16 color names are defined in the \s-1HTML\s0 3.2 standard:
.Sp
.Vb 16
\&        black   => 000000,
\&        silver  => c0c0c0,
\&        gray    => 808080,
\&        white   => ffffff,
\&        maroon  => 800000,
\&        red     => ff0000,
\&        purple  => 800080,
\&        fuchsia => ff00ff,
\&        green   => 008000,
\&        lime    => 00ff00,
\&        olive   => 808000,
\&        yellow  => ffff00
\&        navy    => 000080,
\&        blue    => 0000ff,
\&        teal    => 008080,
\&        aqua    => 00ffff,
.Ve
Many more names are supported in specific browsers, but it is safest
to use the hex codes for other colors.  Helpful color tables can be
located with an internet search for \*(L"\s-1HTML\s0 color tables\*(R". 
.Sp
Besides color, two other character attributes may be set: bold, and italics.
To set a token type to use bold, use the flag
\&\fB\-html\-bold\-xxxxxx\fR or \fB\-hbx\fR, where \fBxxxxxx\fR or \fBx\fR are the long
or short names from the above table.  Conversely, to set a token type to 
\&\s-1NOT\s0 use bold, use \fB\-nohtml\-bold\-xxxxxx\fR or \fB\-nhbx\fR.
.Sp
Likewise, to set a token type to use an italic font, use the flag
\&\fB\-html\-italic\-xxxxxx\fR or \fB\-hix\fR, where again \fBxxxxxx\fR or \fBx\fR are the
long or short names from the above table.  And to set a token type to
\&\s-1NOT\s0 use italics, use \fB\-nohtml\-italic\-xxxxxx\fR or \fB\-nhix\fR.
.Sp
For example, to use bold braces and lime color, non\-bold, italics keywords the
following command would be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        perltidy -html -hbs -hck=00FF00 -nhbk -hik somefile.pl
.Ve
The background color can be specified with \fB\-html\-color\-background=n\fR,
or \fB\-hcbg=n\fR for short, where n is a 6 character hex \s-1RGB\s0 value.  The
default color of text is the value given to \fBpunctuation\fR, which is
black as a default.
.Sp
Here are some notes and hints:
.Sp
1. If you find a preferred set of these parameters, you may want
to create a \fI.perltidyrc\fR file containing them.  See the perltidy man
page for an explanation.
.Sp
2. Rather than specifying values for these parameters, it may be easier
to accept the defaults and then edit a style sheet.  The style sheet
contains helpful comments which should make this easy.
.Sp
3. The syntax-colored html files can be very large, so it may be best to
split large files into smaller pieces to improve download times.
.Sp
4. The list of token types is expected to evolve over time as further
tokenizer improvements allow a refinement in the available token types,
so you should occasionally check for updates to this program if you use
it frequently.

.IP "Parsing Limitations" 4
.IX Item "Parsing Limitations"
Perltidy should work properly on most perl scripts.  It does a lot of
self\-checking, but still, it is possible that an error could be
introduced and go undetected.  Therefore, it is essential to make
careful backups and to test reformatted scripts.
.Sp
The main current limitation is that perltidy does not scan modules
included with 'use' statements.  This makes it necessary to guess the
context of any bare words introduced by such modules.  Perltidy has good
guessing algorithms, but they are not infallible.  When it must guess,
it leaves a message in the log file.
.Sp
If you encounter a bug, please report it.
.IP "What perltidy does not parse and format" 4
.IX Item "What perltidy does not parse and format"
Perltidy indents but does not reformat comments and \f(CW\*(C`qw\*(C'\fR quotes. 
Perltidy does not in any way modify the contents of here documents or
quoted text, even if they contain source code.  (You could, however,
reformat them separately).  Perltidy does not format 'format' sections
in any way.  And, of course, it does not modify pod documents.

When standard input is used, the log file, if saved, is \fIperltidy.LOG\fR,
and any errors are written to \fIperltidy.ERR\fR unless the \fB\-se\fR flag is
set.  These are saved in the current working directory.  If syntax
checking is used, a temporary copy of the input file will be created,
but it will be removed when perltidy finishes.
.Sp
When standard output and syntax checking are used, a temporary copy of the
output file will be created.  It will be removed when perltidy finishes.
.IP "Files overwritten" 4
.IX Item "Files overwritten"
The following file extensions are used by perltidy, and files with these
extensions may be overwritten or deleted: \fI.tdy\fR, \fI.ERR\fR, \fI.LOG\fR, \fI.TEE\fR.
.IP "Files extensions limitations" 4
.IX Item "Files extensions limitations"
Perltidy does not operate on files for which the run could produce a file with
a duplicated file extension.  These extensions are \fI.tdy\fR, \fI.LOG\fR, \fI.ERR\fR,
