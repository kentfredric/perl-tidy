<P>
<H1><A NAME="perltidy todo list">Perltidy TODO List</A></H1>
<P>This is a ``wish-list'' of features to add and things to do.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="hanging comments">Hanging comments</A></H2>
<P>We would like to be able to recognize and format hanging side comments 
as shown below, rather than format them as full-line block comments.</P>
<PRE>
  my $IGNORE = 0;    # number of initial packets to ignore
                     # Not resending old packets on startup.
                     # Get old packets from the database.</PRE>
<P>This update is planned for the near future.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gnu/emacs style indentation">Gnu/emacs style indentation</A></H2>
<P>We would like to be able to indent tables and function calls in the
manner sometimes associated with emacs or GNU:</P>
<PRE>
    %TV = (
            flintstones =&gt; {
                             series  =&gt; &quot;flintstones&quot;,
                             nights  =&gt; [qw(monday thursday friday)],
                             members =&gt; [
                                          {
                                              name =&gt; &quot;fred&quot;,
                                              role =&gt; &quot;lead&quot;,
                                              age  =&gt; 36,
                                          },
   (...)</PRE>
<P>Programming for this is underway.  An experimental implementation, which
is selected with the '-gnu' flag, is being tested.  It formats
lists, without side comments, at the present time.  It does not format
sub call lists.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="documentation">Documentation</A></H2>
<P>A FAQ or maybe COOKBOOK needs to be written, to explain some of the
more subtle formatting issues.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H2>
<P>There are still a couple of bugs listed in the BUGS file that need
to be addressed.  These are low priority, but need to be done.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="tokenization issues">Tokenization issues</A></H2>
<P>It would be nice to introduce some more token types, such as procedure
calls, so that they can be given separate colors in html files.</P>
<P>There are some subtle issues with distinguishing block types that should
eventually be addressed to make the tokenizer more correct, even though
they do not interfere with code beautification.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="modularization">Modularization</A></H2>
<P>It is planned to release perltidy in modules, hopefully this year.
However, the development of the tokenizer and formatter is still very
tightly coupled, and there are still some open tokenization issues that
need to be resolved before the program is split into pieces.  Anyone is
welcome, of course, to extract the tokenizer and use it for other
projects, but it would be good to let me know so that we can coordinate
updates to the tokenizer.</P>
