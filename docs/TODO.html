<HR>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="perltidy todo list">Perltidy TODO List</A></H1>
<P>This is a ``wish-list'' of features to add and things to do.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fix numerous little formatting issues">Fix numerous little formatting issues</A></H2>
<P>There are a large number of little open formatting issues.  I'm working on
them as time permits.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="modularization">Modularization</A></H2>
<P>Modularization work is in progress.  I hope to have modularization patches 
made by Hugh Myers integrated into the next release.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H2>
<P>There are still a couple of bugs listed in the BUGS file that need
to be fixed.  These are low priority compared to formatting
issues, but need to be done.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="improved vertical alignment">Improved Vertical Alignment</A></H2>
<P>Coding modifications are underway to improve the vertical alignment
logic.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="xml">XML</A></H2>
<P>The ability to write a tokenized script in XML looks very useful.  This
would allow the creation of simple utilities to reliably manipulate perl 
code.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="documentation">Documentation</A></H2>
<P>A FAQ is being written to explain some of the
more subtle formatting issues, and to give examples of different
styles.</P>
<P>The tokenizer needs extensive documentation before it can be released
as a separate module.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="html writer">HTML writer</A></H2>
<P>The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
documents or quoted strings.  The tokenizer outputs interpolation
information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
multiline quotes.  Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
identifiers.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="tokenization issues">Tokenization issues</A></H2>
<P>Token type 'M' (for Method) has been reserved for subroutine definition
names.  It needs to be implementd; I've patched around this in the html
writer for now.  I'm considering new token types for prototypes and
attributes, to simplify parsing and formatting.</P>
<P>There are some subtle issues with distinguishing block types that should
be addressed to make the tokenizer more correct, even though they do not
interfere with code beautification.  For example, in most cases the type
of a brace is known when it is encountered. But given this coding
</P>
<PRE>

 sub something {
     {
        bla, bla
     }
     ..
 }</PRE>
<P>you have to examine the first few tokens of the interior set of to
braces to see if it is a code block or anonymous hash reference.  This
needs to be done.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="option to reformat block comments">Option to reformat block comments</A></H2>
<P>I'm looking into an option to use Text::Autoformat to reformat comments.
Thanks to Tim Maher for this suggestion.  Some preliminary testing suggests
that this might best be an interactive tool, something like a spelling checker,
which would walk through a file looking for groups of comments, and present a
proposed a reformatting to the user with a Y/N response request.</P>
<P>One way to do this would be to first implement the XML feature mentioned above,
and then write a utility to read the XML and process it.</P>
