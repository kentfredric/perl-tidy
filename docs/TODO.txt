Perltidy TODO List
    This is a "wish-list" of features to add and things to do.

  Clean up a few -lp issues

    The new -lp feature seems to be working well, but there are a few
    situations where it might be improved. In particular, it needs to be
    updated to handle lists following certain perl keywords.

  Add more formatting options

    Although there are many options already, there is still a need for more
    options to help programmers match particular styles. An example would be
    the manner in which terminal parens of lists are handled.

  Automated testing

    An automated method for testing many combinations of parameter options
    on a variety of test files would be very helpful.

  Documentation

    A FAQ or maybe COOKBOOK needs to be written, to explain some of the more
    subtle formatting issues.

  BUGS

    There are still a couple of bugs listed in the BUGS file that need to be
    addressed. These are low priority, but need to be done.

  Tokenization issues

    It would be nice to introduce some more token types, such as procedure
    calls, so that they can be given separate colors in html files.

    There are some subtle issues with distinguishing block types that should
    eventually be addressed to make the tokenizer more correct, even though
    they do not interfere with code beautification.

  Modularization

    It is planned to release perltidy in modules, hopefully this year.
    However, the development of the tokenizer and formatter is still very
    tightly coupled, and there are still some open tokenization issues that
    need to be resolved before the program is split into pieces. Anyone is
    welcome, of course, to extract the tokenizer and use it for other
    projects, but it would be good to let me know so that we can coordinate
    updates to the tokenizer.
