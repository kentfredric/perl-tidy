Perltidy TODO List
    This is a "wish-list" of features to add and things to do. All of these
    are of interest, but there is no particular schedule for implementing
    them.

  Improved Vertical Alignment
    There are many opportunities for improving vertical alignment.

  improved ?: formatting
    An indentation level should be associated with ?: statements. This will
    make nested ?: statements more readable.

  Fix numerous little formatting issues
    There is, and always will be, a large number of other relatively minor
    formatting issues that need to be addressed.

  XML Output
    A -xml option would allow the creation of simple utilities to reliably
    manipulate perl code.

  Documentation
    A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting issues,
    and to give examples of different styles.

    The tokenizer needs extensive documentation before it can be released as
    a separate module.

  HTML writer
    The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
    documents or quoted strings. The tokenizer outputs interpolation
    information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
    multi-line quotes. Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
    identifiers.

  Tokenization issues
    There are some subtle issues with distinguishing block types that should
    be addressed to make the tokenizer more correct, even though they do not
    interfere with code beautification. For example, in most cases the type
    of a brace is known when it is encountered. But given this coding

     sub something {
         {
            bla, bla
         }
         ..
     }

    we have to examine the first couple of tokens of the interior braces to
    see if it is a code block or anonymous hash reference. This needs to be
    done. Also, brace types of something like ${ ... } are not currently
    labeled as code blocks because this simplifies formatting. However, this
    should be done eventually for correctness.

    Token type 'M' (for Method) has been reserved for subroutine definition
    names. It needs to be implemented; I've patched around this in the html
    writer for now. I'm considering new token types for prototypes and
    attributes, to simplify parsing and formatting.
