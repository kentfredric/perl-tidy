Perltidy TODO List
    This is a "wish-list" of features to add and things to do. All of these
    are of interest, but there is no particular schedule for implementing
    them.

  Improved Vertical Alignment
    There are many opportunities for improving vertical alignment.

  improved ?: formatting
    An indentation level should be associated with ?: statements. This will
    make nested ?: statements more readable.

  Recursive file processing
    A -r flag might be nice.

  Documentation
    A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting issues,
    and to give examples of different styles.

    The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

  HTML writer
    The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
    documents or quoted strings. The tokenizer outputs interpolation
    information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
    multi-line quotes. Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
    identifiers.
