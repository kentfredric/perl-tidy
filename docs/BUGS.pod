=head1 Perltidy open BUGS

 You can help perltidy evolve into a better program.  If you think you

 This file only lists open bugs.  For bugs which have been fixed,

=head2 A here-doc invoked through an 'e' modifier on a pattern replacement text is not recognized 

For example, the output of perltidy for this script has a syntax error:

        my $text="Hello World!\n";
        $text =~ s@Hello@<<'END'@e;
        Goodbye 
        Cruel
        END
        print "$text\n";
