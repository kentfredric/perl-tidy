=head1 Welcome to Perltidy!

Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.  It can also
write scripts in html format.

Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public
License -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Perltidy is programmed to work with versions of Perl as old as 5.004.
(You can find your version with C<perl -v>).  However, some systems this
old may have problems, particularly Windows versions.

This this release was successfully tested on a 5.004_04 linux
distribution (1997) and a 5.005_03 Windows version (ActiveState
build 522, 1999).

The following modules are not required, but perltidy may use them if
detected:

  Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
  HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected
  Pod::Html will be used to format pod text

The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory will
about 1 Mb.
