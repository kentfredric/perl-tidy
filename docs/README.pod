=head1 Welcome to Perltidy!

Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.

Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public
License -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

There are two source distribution files, a F<.tar.gz> "tarball" and a
zip file, F<.zip>.  The only difference is that the line endings have
been changed from Unix-style <lf> in the F<.tar.gz> to Windows-style
<cr><lf> in the F<.zip> version.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

Perltidy should work under a standard distribution of Perl version 5.004
or later.  (You can find your version with C<perl -v>). It may use these
other modules if detected:

  Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
  HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected

The following modules are not required, but they can be used to allow
your own programs to avoid passing filenames to the perltidy main
module:

  IO::Scalar
  IO::ScalarArray

The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory
will about 1 Mb.  (If neccessary, this could be reduced to about 320k
by using perltidy to squeeze itself down using B<-dac --mangle> .)

=head1 INSTALLATION

Please see the file INSTALL for installation information.

=head1 WHAT NEXT

Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.

Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

Documentation can be found in the F<docs> directory, and it can also be 
found at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net

Reading the brief tutorial should help you use perltidy effectively.  

Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge occasionally
for updates if you find that it is useful.  New releases are announced
on freshmeat.net.

=head1 FEEDBACK / BUG REPORTS

If you see ways to improve this document for the particular system on
which you install perltidy, please let the me know so that it can be
updated.

Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome.  Attach the smallest
piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue, plus a .LOG file 
if appropriate.  Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

Thank You
