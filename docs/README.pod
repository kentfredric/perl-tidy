=head1 Welcome to Perltidy!

Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.

Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public
License -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

There are two source distribution files, a F<.tgz> "tarball" for unix
systems and a zip file, F<.zip> for Windows.  The only differences is
that the line endings have been changed to <cr><lf> for the Windows
version.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

There are very few.  Perltidy has been tested on perl versions 5.004 and
later.  It will not work with earlier versions because of the way it
uses IO::File.  It is known to work under Unix systems, Windows 95 and
later, and VMS.  It does not require any non-standard modules to work,
but it may use certain modules if detected, as follows:

  POSIX    will be used to make temporary file names with tmpnam() 
  Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
  HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected

The following modules are not required, but you may use them in your
own programs to make calls to the perltidy main module:

  IO::Scalar
  IO::ScalarArray

=head1 INSTALLATION

Please see the file INSTALL for installation information.

Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.

Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

Documentation can be found in the F<docs> directory, and it can also be

Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge occasionally
for updates if you find that it is useful.  New releases are announced

=head1 FEEDBACK / BUG REPORTS

If you see ways to improve this document for the particular system on
which you install Perltidy, please let the me know so that it can be
updated.

Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome.  Attach the smallest
piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue, plus a .LOG file from
a Perltidy run, if appropriate.  Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

Thank You
