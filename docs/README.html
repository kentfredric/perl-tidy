<P>
<H1><A NAME="welcome to perltidy!">Welcome to Perltidy!</A></H1>
<P>Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.</P>
<P>Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public
License -- please see the included file ``COPYING'' for details.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</A></H1>
<P>The main prerequisite is that your version of Perl not be too old.</P>
<P>Perltidy is programmed to work with versions as old as 5.004.  (You
can find your version with <CODE>perl -v</CODE>).  However, some systems this
old may have problems, particularly Windows versions.</P>
<P>This this release was successfully tested on a 5.004_04 linux
distribution (1997) and a 5.005_03 Windows version (ActiveState
build 522, 1999).</P>
<P>The following modules are not required, but perltidy may use them if
detected:</P>
<PRE>
  Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
  HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected</PRE>
<P>The following modules are not required, but they can be used to allow
your own programs to avoid passing filenames to the perltidy main
module:</P>
<PRE>
  IO::Scalar
  IO::ScalarArray</PRE>
<P>The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory will
about 1 Mb.  (If really necessary, this could be reduced to about 320k by
using perltidy to squeeze itself down using <STRONG>perltidy -dac --mangle Tidy.pm</STRONG>
.)</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="download">DOWNLOAD</A></H1>
<P>There are two source distribution files:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A <EM>.tgz</EM> ``tarball'', with Unix-style &lt;lf&gt; line endings, and
<P></P>
<LI>
A zip file, <EM>.zip</EM>, with Windows-style &lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt; line endings.
<P></P></UL>
<P>Here are some things to watch out for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Be sure to get the file with appropriate line endings.  For example,
under Unix the pod utilities will not work correctly with Windows line
endings.
<P></P>
<LI>
Some browsers do unwanted transformations to files and filenames during
download.  You can usually fix things after you figure out what
happened.  For example, some browsers will decompress the <EM>.tgz</EM> file
without changing the file extension.  So if it does not decompress, see
if it may already be a <EM>.tar</EM> file.  Under Unix systems, the <STRONG>file</STRONG>
command can tell the format.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation">INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>For most standard installations, the standard Makefile.PL method should work:</P>
<PRE>
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install</PRE>
<P>But please at least take a quick look at the INSTALL file.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="what next">WHAT NEXT</A></H1>
<P>Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.</P>
<P>Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.</P>
<P>Documentation can be found in the <EM>docs</EM> directory, and it can also be 
found at <A HREF="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net">http://perltidy.sourceforge.net</A></P>
<P>Reading the brief tutorial should help you use perltidy effectively.</P>
<P>Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge occasionally
for updates if you find that it is useful.  New releases are announced
on freshmeat.net.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="feedback / bug reports">FEEDBACK / BUG REPORTS</A></H1>
<P>If you see ways to improve this document for the particular system on
which you install perltidy, please let the me know so that it can be
updated.</P>
<P>Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome.  Attach the smallest
piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue, plus a .LOG file 
if appropriate.  Your efforts are greatly appreciated!</P>
<P>Thank You</P>
