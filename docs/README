Welcome to Perltidy!
    Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts. It can also
    write scripts in html format.

    Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public License
    -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

PREREQUISITES
    Perltidy is programmed to work with versions of Perl as old as 5.004.
    (You can find your version with "perl -v"). However, some systems this
    old may have problems, particularly Windows versions.

    This this release was successfully tested on a 5.004_04 linux
    distribution (1997) and a 5.005_03 Windows version (ActiveState build
    522, 1999).

    The following modules are not required, but perltidy may use them if
    detected:

      Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
      HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected
      Pod::Html will be used to format pod text

    The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory
    will about 1 Mb.

DOWNLOAD
    There are two source distribution files:

    *   A .tgz "tarball", with Unix-style <lf> line endings, and

    *   A zip file, .zip, with Windows-style <cr><lf> line endings.

    In addition, the web site has links to debian and RPM packages.

INSTALLATION
    For most standard installations, the standard Makefile.PL method should
    work:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

    The INSTALL file has additional installation notes, and tells how to use
    perltidy without doing an installation.

    Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

    Documentation can be found in the docs directory, and it can also be
