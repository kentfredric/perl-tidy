Welcome to Perltidy!
    Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.

    Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public License
    -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

PREREQUISITES
    The main prerequisite is that your version of Perl not be too old.

    Perltidy is programmed to work with versions as old as 5.004. (You can
    find your version with "perl -v"). However, some systems this old may
    have problems, particularly Windows versions.

    This this release was successfully tested on a 5.004_04 linux
    distribution (1997) and a 5.005_03 Windows version (ActiveState build
    522, 1999).

    The following modules are not required, but perltidy may use them if
    detected:

      Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
      HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected

    The following modules are not required, but they can be used to allow
    your own programs to avoid passing filenames to the perltidy main
    module:

      IO::Scalar
      IO::ScalarArray

    The total disk space needed after removing the installation directory
    will about 1 Mb. (If really necessary, this could be reduced to about
    320k by using perltidy to squeeze itself down using perltidy -dac
    --mangle Tidy.pm .)

DOWNLOAD
    There are two source distribution files:

    *   A .tgz "tarball", with Unix-style <lf> line endings, and

    *   A zip file, .zip, with Windows-style <cr><lf> line endings.

    Here are some things to watch out for:

    *   Be sure to get the file with appropriate line endings. For example,
        under Unix the pod utilities will not work correctly with Windows
        line endings.

    *   Some browsers do unwanted transformations to files and filenames
        during download. You can usually fix things after you figure out
        what happened. For example, some browsers will decompress the .tgz
        file without changing the file extension. So if it does not
        decompress, see if it may already be a .tar file. Under Unix
        systems, the file command can tell the format.

INSTALLATION
    For most standard installations, the standard Makefile.PL method should
    work:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

    But please at least take a quick look at the INSTALL file.

WHAT NEXT
    Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.

    Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

    Documentation can be found in the docs directory, and it can also be
    found at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net

    Reading the brief tutorial should help you use perltidy effectively.

    Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge
    occasionally for updates if you find that it is useful. New releases are
    announced on freshmeat.net.

FEEDBACK / BUG REPORTS
    If you see ways to improve this document for the particular system on
    which you install perltidy, please let the me know so that it can be
    updated.

    Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome. Attach the smallest
    piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue, plus a .LOG file if
    appropriate. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

    Thank You
