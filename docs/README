Welcome to Perltidy!
    Perltidy is a tool to indent and reformat perl scripts.

    Perltidy is free software released under the GNU General Public License
    -- please see the included file "COPYING" for details.

    There are two source distribution files, a .tgz "tarball" for unix
    systems and a zip file, .zip for Windows. The only differences is that
    the line endings have been changed to <cr><lf> for the Windows version.

PREREQUISITES
    There are very few. The main requirement is Perl version 5.004 or later.
    It is known to work under Unix systems, Windows 95 and later, and VMS.
    It should work with MacPerl. It does not require any non-standard
    modules to work, but it may use certain modules if detected, as follows:

      Win32    will be used to help identify a Windows system if detected
      HTML::Entities  will be used to encode HTML entities if detected

    The following modules are not required, but they can be used to allow
    your own programs to avoid passing filenames to the perltidy main
    module:

      IO::Scalar
      IO::ScalarArray

INSTALLATION
    Please see the file INSTALL for installation information.

WHAT NEXT
    Please see the CHANGES file for notices of any recent updates.

    Please see the BUGS file for a list of all known open bugs.

    Documentation can be found in the docs directory, and it can also be
    found at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net

    Reading the brief tutorial should help you use Perltidy effectively.

    Perltidy is still being developed, so please check sourceforge
    occasionally for updates if you find that it is useful. New releases are
    announced on freshmeat.net.

FEEDBACK / BUG REPORTS
    If you see ways to improve this document for the particular system on
    which you install Perltidy, please let the me know so that it can be
    updated.

    Bug reports, comments and suggestions are welcome. Attach the smallest
    piece of code which demonstrates the bug or issue, plus a .LOG file from
    a Perltidy run, if appropriate. Your efforts are greatly appreciated!

    Thank You
