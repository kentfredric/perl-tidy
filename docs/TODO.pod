=head1 Perltidy TODO List

This is a partial "wish-list" of features to add and things to do.  All of
these are of interest, but there is no particular schedule for implementing
them.  

=head2 Improved Vertical Alignment

There are many opportunities for improving vertical alignment. 

=head2 More options for controling placement of opening/closing tokens

Many have requested even more options to control opening and closing token
placement.  

=head2 improved ?: formatting

An indentation level should be associated with ?: statements.
This will make nested ?: statements more readable.

=head2 improved internal if/unless formatting

Consider giving internal if/unless statements an additional level
of indentation.  This would avoid running out of indentation levels.
Suggested by Jeff Armstorng. For example, we would like the 'ands' in
the following statement to be indented more than the if:

    return $ship->chargeWeapons("phaser-canon")
      if $encounter->description eq 'klingon'
      and $ship->firepower >= $encounter->firepower
      and $location->status ne 'neutral';

=head2 enable -ole under Windows

This only works reliably under unix at present.

=head2 Documentation

A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting
issues, and to give examples of different styles.

The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

=head2 HTML writer

The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
documents or quoted strings.  The tokenizer outputs interpolation
information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
multi-line quotes.  Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
identifiers.

=head2 Recursive file processing

A -r flag might be nice.
