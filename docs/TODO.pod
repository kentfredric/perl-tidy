=head1 Perltidy TODO List

This is a "wish-list" of features to add and things to do.  All of these
are of interest, but there is no particular schedule for implementing
them.  

=head2 Improved Vertical Alignment

There are many opportunities for improving vertical alignment. 

=head2 improved ?: formatting

An indentation level should be associated with ?: statements.
This will make nested ?: statements more readable.

=head2 Recursive file processing

A -r flag might be nice.

=head2 Documentation

A FAQ is needed to explain some of the more subtle formatting
issues, and to give examples of different styles.

The -formatter callback object documentation is incomplete.

=head2 HTML writer

The HTML writer does not colorize interpolated identifiers in here
documents or quoted strings.  The tokenizer outputs interpolation
information for here docs; it still needs to be updated to do this for
multi-line quotes.  Then code needs to be written to scan for and markup
identifiers.
