<H1><A NAME="a brief perltidy tutorial">A Brief Perltidy Tutorial</A></H1>
<P>Perltidy can save you a lot of tedious editing if you spend a few
minutes learning to use it effectively.  There are a large number of
options available for customizing it, but for most programmers the
default parameter set will be satisfactory, with perhaps a few
additional parameters to account for tabbing and style preferences.</P>
<P>This tutorial assumes that perltidy has been installed on your system.
Installation instructions accompany the package.  To follow along with
this tutorial, please find a small Perl script and place a copy in a
temporary directory.  For example, here is a small script (from the book
Learning Perl 2nd edition, by Randall Schwartz and Tom Christiansen
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl2/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperl2/</A>):</P>

 #Learning Perl Appendix A, Exercise 4.2
 print &quot;What temperature is it? &quot;;
 chop($temperature = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
 if ($temperature &gt; 75) {
   print &quot;Too hot!\n&quot;;
 } elsif ($temperature &lt; 68) {
   print &quot;Too cold!\n&quot;;
 } else {
   print &quot;Just right!\n&quot;;
 }</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="a first test">A First Test</A></H2>
<P>Assume that the name of your script is <EM>testfile.pl</EM>.  You can reformat it
with the default options to use the style recommended in the perlstyle man
pages with the command:</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>Try it now.  Perltidy never overwrites your original file.  In this
case, its output will go to a file named <EM>testfile.pl.tdy</EM>, which you
should examine now with your editor.  Here is what the above file looks
like with the default options:</P>
<PRE>
 #Learning Perl Appendix A, Exercise 4.2
 print &quot;What temperature is it? &quot;;
 chop( $temperature = &lt;STDIN&gt; );
 if ( $temperature &gt; 75 ) {
     print &quot;Too hot!\n&quot;;
 }
 elsif ( $temperature &lt; 68 ) {
     print &quot;Too cold!\n&quot;;
 }
 else {
     print &quot;Just right!\n&quot;;
 }</PRE>
<P>If you are executing perltidy on a single file, and you do not like the
default name, you can control the name of the output file with the <STRONG>-o</STRONG>
parameter.  Try the following command,</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy testfile.pl -o=testfile.new.pl</PRE>
<P>which will create a file named <EM>testfile.new.pl</EM>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="making backups">Making Backups</A></H2>
<P>In an actual project, at this point you could make a backup copy
of the original script and then rename <EM>testfile.pl.tdy</EM> to
be <EM>testfile.pl</EM>.  It is very important to have a standard procedure
for backing up your script in case something goes wrong.
For a small project, a simple backup procedure using RCS could be as
follows (see the <CODE>rcsintro(1)</CODE> man page).</P>
<PRE>
        ci -l testfile.pl
        perltidy testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>Then, if no problems are seen, update to the new version using</P>
<PRE>
        mv testfile.pl testfile.pl.bak
        mv testfile.pl.tdy testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>This has the effect of keeping a historical record of the script in the RCS
directory, and a current separate backup as <EM>testfile.pl.bak</EM>.  Of course, you
should make regular additional backups to other media as well.  Perltidy, a
relatively large script, was itself developed with this backup procedure.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="tabs or spaces">Tabs or Spaces?</A></H2>
<P>With indentation, there is always a tab issue to resolve.  By default,
perltidy will output lines with 4 leading spaces per level of
indentation.  The reason is that this will be displayed correctly
by virtually all editors.  If you prefer,
you may also choose to use one leading tab character for
each level of indentation by using the <STRONG>-t</STRONG> flag.  Most editors
display tabs as 8 spaces, but they normally have a switch to change
this.  If you choose tabs, you should use this switch to change tabs to
display as 4 columns, because that is the default assumption made by
perltidy in aligning lists and side comments vertically.</P>
<P>(The number 4 is the indentation spacing suggested in <CODE>perlstyle(1)</CODE> for Perl
scripts, but you may change this to any number ``n'' of columns with the
flag <STRONG>-i=n</STRONG>).</P>
<P>For example, the commands for the vim editor are as follows.  
To change to 4 spaces per tab, use ``:set ts=4'' and ``:set sw=4''.  If you are
using real spaces instead of tabs, you will also want to expand
tabs to spaces with ``:set et''.  All of these commands can be put in a
comment (modeline) at the end of a script like this:</P>
<P># vi: set ts=4 sw=4 et:</P>
<P>Fortunately, perltidy makes it easy to change indentation spaces and tabbing
assumptions at any time.</P>
<P>To get some practice, try these examples, and examine the resulting
<EM>testfile.pl.tdy</EM> file:</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -i=3 testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>This changes the default of 4 spaces per indentation level to be 3.  Now
just to emphasize the point, try this and examine the result:</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -i=0 testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>There will be no indentation at all in this case.</P>
<P>Now try using tabs with the <STRONG>-t</STRONG> command</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -t testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>Look at the file with your editor, and tell it to display tabs
as 4 columns so that the file displays properly.</P>
<P>This is a good place to mention a few points regarding the input flags.
First, for each option, there are two forms, a long form and a short
form, and either may be used.</P>
<P>For example, if you want to change the number of columns corresponding to one
indentation level to 3 (from the default of 4) you may use either</P>
<PRE>
 -i=3   or  --indent-columns=3</PRE>
<P>The short forms are convenient for entering parameters by hand, whereas
the long forms, though often ridiculously long, are self-documenting and
therefore useful in configuration scripts.  You may use either one or
two dashes ahead of the parameters.  Also, the '=' sign is optional, 
and may be a single space instead.  However, the value of a parameter
must NOT be adjacent to the flag, like this <STRONG>-i3</STRONG> (WRONG).  Also,
flags must be input separately, never bundled together.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="style variations, or, what are all of those other parameters for">Style Variations, or, What are all of those other parameters for?</A></H2>
<P>There are a large number of detailed formatting options, and they may be
grouped into whitespace controls and line break controls.  If you are
already happy with your formatting, and just want perltidy to update
your indentation, you can bypass all of these controls, and just have
perltidy perform indenting with the flag <STRONG>-io</STRONG>, which stands for
``indent only''.  If you are happy with your whitespace, but would like
both indenting and line break changes, you can use the command <STRONG>-fws</STRONG>,
which stands for ``freeze whitespace''.  Likewise, there is a <STRONG>-fnl</STRONG>
flag, which stands for ``freeze newlines'', and tells perltidy to do
indentation and whitespace adjustment, but no line break changes.</P>
<P>Perltidy has to make some kind of default selection of formatting
options, and its choice is to try to follow the suggestions in the
perlstyle man pages.  Many programmers more or less follow these
suggestions with the exception that ``cuddled elses'' are widely used.  If
you prefer cuddled elses, use the <STRONG>-ce</STRONG> flag.  If you
are unfamiliar with this term, a ``cuddled else'' is something like this:
'} else {', so named because the ``else'' has been ``cuddled'' between the
two braces.</P>
<P>While style preferences vary, most people would agree that it is important to
maintain a uniform style within a script, and this is a major benefit provided
by perltidy.  Once you have decided on which, if any, special options you
prefer, you may want to avoid having to enter them each time you run it.  You
can do this by creating a special file named <EM>.perltidyrc</EM> in either your home
directory or your current directory.  (Note the leading ``.'' in the file name).
Perltidy will first look in your current directory, and if it does not find
one, it will look in your home directory.  This file is free format.  It is
simply a list of parameters, just as they would be entered on a command line.
Any number of lines may be used, with any number of parameters per line,
although it may be easiest to read with one parameter per line.  Blank lines
are ignored, and text after a '#' is ignored to the end of a line.</P>
<P>Here is an example of a <EM>.perltidyrc</EM> file:</P>
<PRE>
  # This is a simple of a .perltidyrc configuration file
  # This implements a highly spaced style
  -bl    # braces on new lines
  -pt=0  # parens not tight at all
  -bt=0  # braces not tight
  -sbt=0 # square brackets not tight</PRE>
<P>If you experiment with this file, remember that it is in your directory,
since if you are running on a Unix system, files beginning with
a ``.'' are normally hidden.  If you are unsure if a <EM>.perltidyrc</EM> file is in
effect, you can always use the <STRONG>-log</STRONG> flag to create a .LOG file and 
look at the top.  It will tell you.</P>
<P>If you have a <EM>.perltidyrc</EM> file, and want perltidy to ignore it,
use the <STRONG>-npro</STRONG> flag on the command line.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the log file">The Log File</A></H2>
<P>One last topic that needs to be touched upon concerns the <EM>.LOG</EM> file.
This is where perltidy writes messages that are not normally of great
interest, but which just might occasionally be useful.  This file is not
saved, though, unless there is an error or you ask for it to be saved.</P>
<P>There are a couple of ways to save a log file.  For a relatively sparce
log file use</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -log testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>and for a verbose log file use</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -g testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>The difference is that the first form only saves detailed information
at least every 50th line, while the second form saves detailed information
about every line.  The default log file is saved with the
first format, but if you are looking for a nesting problem, you will
probably want to rerun perltidy using the second form.</P>
<P>So returning to our example, lets force perltidy to save a
verbose log file by issuing the following command</P>
<PRE>
 perltidy -g testfile.pl</PRE>
<P>You will find that a file named <EM>testfile.pl.LOG</EM> has been
created in your directory.</P>
<P>Take a few minutes to examine this file.  It is a text file with a
combination of warning messages and informative messages.  It can be
particularly helpful if you are trying to track down a brace nesting
error, because it prints out the nesting of braces, parens, and square
brackets.</P>
<P>You will see the nesting depths for each line of square brackets, parens, and
braces in the left column.  On the right are any warning messages plus the
first few characters of each line.  Warning messages start with ``&gt;&gt;&gt;'', and
lines of code start with dots, one dot per level of indentation.  You could
also determine the indentation level by examining output script, but sometimes,
with deep indentation, it is easier to examine the dots in the log file.</P>
<P>For example, here one line from the .LOG file for the above test file.</P>
<PRE>
 L7:7     i1:1 {          .print &quot;Too cold!\n&quot;;</PRE>
<P>The ``L7:7'' means that old line 7 became <EM>approximately</EM> new line 7.
(Actually it becomes new line 8; the discrepancy is because logfile
entries are written when old lines are read, and before their final
destinations are precisely known).  The ``i1:1'' tells us that line 7 of
the input file had leading spaces implying an indentation level 1 and
that the braces also imply a structural indentation level of 1.  The ``{''
tells us that the starting nesting level of this line was  one opening
curly brace.</P>
<P>The text</P>
<PRE>
 .print &quot;Too cold!\n&quot;</PRE>
<P>shows the first characters of this particular line of the script, with
one leading dot per indentation level.  Among the other messages that
perltidy writes in the log file are the starting and ending locations of
here documents and multi-line quotes.  At the end of the log file is
some useful summary information.  One particular item worth noting is
the summary of indentation disagreements.  If you try to keep your
script properly indented, by using perltidy regurlarly, 
then this should show you precisely the
location of any extra or missing curly brace in the script.</P>
<P>That's all you need to know to get started using perltidy.  You will
want to delete unwanted files in the temporary directory created in this
tutorial.  Additional special features and capabilities can be found in
the manual pages for perltidy.</P>
