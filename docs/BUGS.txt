Perltidy open BUGS
     You can help perltidy evolve into a better program.  If you think you
     have hit a bug or weird behavior, or have a suggested improvement,
     please send a note to perltidy at users.sourceforge.net.

     This file only lists open bugs.  For bugs which have been fixed, 
     see the ChangeLog.  

  A here-doc invoked through an 'e' modifier on a pattern replacement text is not recognized
    For example, the output of perltidy for this script has a syntax error:

            my $text="Hello World!\n";
            $text =~ s@Hello@<<'END'@e;
            Goodbye 
            Cruel
            END
            print "$text\n";

    A workaround is to put the here-doc in a temporary string and then do
    the substitution:

            my $text="Hello World!\n";
            my $str=<<'END';
            Goodbye 
            Cruel
            END
            $text =~ s@Hello@$str@e;
            print "$text\n";

  The --extrude option can occasionally produce code with syntax errors
    The --extrude tries to put as many newlines in the formatted code as
    possible. This option is of limited use for formatting, but it has been
    helpful for debugging purposes. Occasionally it will produce code which
    Perl considers to have a syntax error. These problems usually involve
    code where Perl is having to guess the tokenization. For example,
    --extrude will currently cause a syntax error in the following line:

     utime $inc+0 ? ($mtime, $ntime) : ($atime, $atime), $file;
