Perltidy open BUGS
     You can help perltidy evolve into a better program.  If you think you
     have hit a bug or weird behavior, or have a suggested improvement,
     please send a note to perltidy at users.sourceforge.net.

     This file only lists open bugs.  For bugs which have been fixed,

  perl v5.6.0 features not yet parsed correctly (SLH, 2001-03-31)

    Subroutine attributes have not been implemented in perltdy yet. For
    example:

       sub witch : locked {
         ...        
       }

    Perltidy does not correctly parse prototypes when they are on a separate
    line from the subroutine name. For example, this would cause an error:

       sub pi 
       ()
       {
         4 * atan2(1,1);
       }

    For now, the workaround is to place the prototype on the same line as
    the sub name, like this:

       sub pi ()
       {
         4 * atan2(1,1);
       }
