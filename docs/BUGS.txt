Perltidy open BUGS
     You can help perltidy evolve into a better program.  If you think you
     have hit a bug or weird behavior, or have a suggested improvement,
     please send a note to perltidy at users.sourceforge.net.

     This file only lists open bugs.  For bugs which have been fixed, 
     see the ChangeLog.  

  A here-doc invoked through an 'e' modifier on the replacement text is not recognized (SLH, 2001-08-02)

    For example, the output of perltidy for this script has a syntax error:

            my $text="Hello World!\n";
            $text =~ s@Hello@<<'END'@e;
            Goodbye 
            Cruel
            END
            print "$text\n";

  Limitation parsing subroutine attributes and prototypes

    Subroutine prototypes and attributes (a perl 5.6 feature) are not
    correctly parsed unless they are on the same line as the subroutine
    name. For example, this would cause an error:

       sub pi 
       ()
       {
         4 * atan2(1,1);
       }

    The workaround is to place the prototype and/or attribute on the same
    line as the sub name, like this:

       sub pi ()
       {
         4 * atan2(1,1);
       }
