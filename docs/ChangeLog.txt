Perltidy Change Log
     You can help perltidy evolve into a better program.  If you think you
     have hit a bug or unusual behavior, or have a suggested improvement,
     please send a note to perltidy at users.sourceforge.net.  

  2001 xx xx

     -Corrected an invalid pattern (\R should have been just R), changed
     $^W =1 to BEGIN {$^W=1} to use warnings in compile phase, and corrected
     several unnecessary 'my' declarations. Many thanks to Wolfgang Weisselberg,
     2001-06-12, for catching these errors.
 
     -A '-bar' flag has been added to require braces to always be on the
     right, even for multi-line if and foreach statements.  For example,
     the default formatting of a long if statement would be:

            if ($bigwasteofspace1 && $bigwasteofspace2
              || $bigwasteofspace3 && $bigwasteofspace4)
            {
                bigwastoftime();
            }

     With -bar, the formatting is:

            if ($bigwasteofspace1 && $bigwasteofspace2
              || $bigwasteofspace3 && $bigwasteofspace4) {
                bigwastoftime();
            }
     Suggested by Eli Fidler 2001-06-11.

     -Uploaded perltidy to sourceforge cvs 2001-06-10.

     -A '-gnu' flag has been added which causes lists to be indented with
     extra indentation in the manner sometimes associated with emacs or the
     GNU suggestions.  It's not perfect yet but it is now quite useful and
     should improve over time.  Many thanks to Ian Stuart for this
     suggestion and for much help in testing it. The manual has been updated
     to discuss this.

     -Subroutine call parameter lists are now formatted as other lists.
     This should improve formatting of tables being passed via subroutine
     calls.  This will also cause full indentation ('-i=n, default n= 4) of
     continued parameter list lines rather than just the number of spaces
     given with -ci=n, default n=2.
 
     -Added support for hanging side comments.  Perltidy identifies a hanging
     side comment as a comment immediately following a line with a side
     comment or another hanging side comment.  This should work in most
     cases.  It can be deactivated with --no-hanging-side-comments (-nhsc).
     The manual has been updated to discuss this.  Suggested by Brad
     Eisenberg some time ago, and finally implemented.

  2001 06 08

     -fixed problem with parsing command parameters containing quoted
     strings in .perltidyrc files. (Reported by Roger Esper Llima 2001-06-07).

     -added two command line flags, --want-break-after and 
     --want-break-before, which allow changing whether perltidy
     breaks lines before or after any operators.  Please see the revised 
     man pages for details.

     -added system-wide configuration file capability.
     If perltidy does not find a .perltidyrc command line file in
     the current directory, nor in the home directory, it now looks
     for '/usr/local/etc/perltidyrc' and then for '/etc/perltidyrc'.
     (Suggested by Roger Esper Llima 2001-05-31).

     -fixed problem in which spaces were trimmed from lines of a multi-line
     quote. (Reported by Roger Esper Llima 2001-05-30).  This is an 
     uncommon situation, but serious, because it could conceivably change
     the proper function of a script.

     -fixed problem in which a semicolon was incorrectly added within 
     an anonymous hash.  (Reported by A.C. Yardley, 2001-5-23).
     (You would know if this happened, because perl would give a syntax
     error for the resulting script).

     -fixed problem in which an incorrect error message was produced
      after a version number on a 'use' line, like this ( Reported 
      by Andres Kroonmaa, 2001-5-14):

                  use CGI 2.42 qw(fatalsToBrowser);

      Other than the extraneous error message, this bug was harmless.

  2001 04 06

     -fixed serious bug in which the last line of some multi-line quotes or
      patterns was given continuation indentation spaces.  This may make
      a pattern incorrect unless it uses the /x modifier.  To find
      instances of this error in scripts which have been formatted with
      earlier versions of perltidy, run with the -chk flag, which has
      been added for this purpose (SLH, 2001-04-05).

      ** So, please check previously formatted scripts by running with -chk
      at least once **

     -continuation indentation has been reprogrammed to be hierarchical, 
      which improves deeply nested structures.

     -fixed problem with undefined value in list formatting (reported by Michael
      Langner 2001-04-05)

     -Switched to graphical display of nesting in .LOG files.  If an
      old format string was "(1 [0 {2", the new string is "{{(".  This
      is easier to read and also shows the order of nesting.

     -added outdenting of cuddled paren structures, like  ")->pack(".

     -added line break and outdenting of ')->' so that instead of

            $mw->Label(
              -text   => "perltidy",
              -relief => 'ridge')->pack;
 
      the current default is:

            $mw->Label(
              -text   => "perltidy",
              -relief => 'ridge'
            )->pack;

      (requested by Michael Langner 2001-03-31; in the future this could 
      be controlled by a command-line parameter).

     -revised list indentation logic, so that lists following an assignment
      operator get one full indentation level, rather than just continuation 
      indentation.  Also corrected some minor glitches in the continuation 
      indentation logic. 

     -Fixed problem with unwanted continuation indentation after a blank line 
     (reported by Erik Thaysen 2001-03-28):

     -minor update to avoid stranding a single '(' on one line

  2001 03 28:

     -corrected serious error tokenizing filehandles, in which a sub call 
     after a print or printf, like this:
        print usage() and exit;
     became this:
        print usage () and exit;
     Unfortunately, this converts 'usage' to a filehandle.  To fix this, rerun
     perltidy; it will look for this situation and issue a warning. 

     -fixed another cuddled-else formatting bug (Reported by Craig Bourne)

     -added several diagnostic --dump routines
 
     -added token-level whitespace controls (suggested by Hans Ecke)

  2001 03 23:

     -added support for special variables of the form ${^WANT_BITS}

     -space added between scalar and left paren in 'for' and 'foreach' loops,
      (suggestion by Michael Cartmell):

        for $i( 1 .. 20 )   # old
        for $i ( 1 .. 20 )   # new

     -html now outputs cascading style sheets (thanks to suggestion from
      Hans Ecke)

     -flags -o and -st now work with -html

     -added missing -html documentation for comments (noted by Alex Izvorski)

     -support for VMS added (thanks to Michael Cartmell for code patches and 
       testing)

     -v-strings implemented (noted by Hans Ecke and Michael Cartmell; extensive
       testing by Michael Cartmell)

     -fixed problem where operand may be empty at line 3970 
      (\b should be just b in lines 3970, 3973) (Thanks to Erik Thaysen, 
      Keith Marshall for bug reports)

     -fixed -ce bug (cuddled else), where lines like '} else {' were indented
      (Thanks to Shawn Stepper and Rick Measham for reporting this)

  2001 03 04:

     -fixed undefined value in line 153 (only worked with -I set)
     (Thanks to Mike Stok, Phantom of the Opcodes, Ian Ehrenwald, and others)

     -fixed undefined value in line 1069 (filehandle problem with perl versions <
     5.6) (Thanks to Yuri Leikind, Mike Stok, Michael Holve, Jeff Kolber)

  2001 03 03:

     -Initial announcement at freshmeat.net; started Change Log
     (Unfortunately this version was DOA, but it was fixed the next day)
