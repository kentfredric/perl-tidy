<P>You use the '!' key to run it as a filter.  For example:
Assuming perltidy is in your path, to run it on the whole text, use
:%!perltidy -q</P>
<P>To run it on a selected group of lines, you can first select
the lines in command mode with
V  
(then use arrows or any other movement method)
:!perltidy -q</P>
<P>The '-q' is optional (quiet), and keeps any error messages from appearing 
on the screen.  If you don't use -q, you might have to use the 'u'
undo key to go back to the previous state.</P>
