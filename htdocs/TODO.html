<HR>
<P>
<H1><A NAME="perltidy todo list">Perltidy TODO List</A></H1>
<P>This is a ``wish-list'' of features to add and things to do.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="clean up a few lp issues">Clean up a few -lp issues</A></H2>
<P>The new -lp feature seems to be working well, but there are a few
situations where it might be improved.  In particular, it needs
to be updated to handle lists following certain perl keywords.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="add more formatting options">Add more formatting options</A></H2>
<P>Although there are many options already, there is still a need for
more options to help programmers match particular styles.  An example
would be the manner in which terminal parens of lists are handled.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="automated testing">Automated testing</A></H2>
<P>An automated method for testing many combinations of parameter options 
on a variety of test files would be very helpful.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="documentation">Documentation</A></H2>
<P>A FAQ or maybe COOKBOOK needs to be written, to explain some of the
more subtle formatting issues.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="bugs">BUGS</A></H2>
<P>There are still a couple of bugs listed in the BUGS file that need
to be addressed.  These are low priority, but need to be done.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="tokenization issues">Tokenization issues</A></H2>
<P>It would be nice to introduce some more token types, such as procedure
calls, so that they can be given separate colors in html files.</P>
<P>There are some subtle issues with distinguishing block types that should
eventually be addressed to make the tokenizer more correct, even though
they do not interfere with code beautification.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="modularization">Modularization</A></H2>
<P>It is planned to release perltidy in modules, hopefully this year.
However, the development of the tokenizer and formatter is still very
tightly coupled, and there are still some open tokenization issues that
need to be resolved before the program is split into pieces.  Anyone is
welcome, of course, to extract the tokenizer and use it for other
projects, but it would be good to let me know so that we can coordinate
updates to the tokenizer.</P>
