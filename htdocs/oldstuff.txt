.h2 About Perltidy

Around June of 2000 I needed to clean up some Perl scripts but was
unable to find a suitable tool for the job.  So I wrote Perltidy.  My
intention was to just write an indenter, but once indenting was
working correctly, I decided that it would be nice to extend it to be a
full-featured formatter, covering as many of the recommendations in the
perlstyle man page as possible.  I hope you find it useful.
