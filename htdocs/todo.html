<H1><A NAME="perltidy status and todo list">Perltidy Status and TODO List</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="status">Status</A></H2>
<P>Perltidy has been robust and stable for several months.  There are no
known bugs at the present time (I call them ``issues'' instead).  There
are (and will always be) areas for formatting improvement.  I expect to
update the program frequently during year 2001 as formatting
improvements are made.  Please keep your version up to date, and report
any bugs.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="oneline block issues">One-Line block issues</A></H2>
<P>One-line blocks can be surprisingly tricky to handle.  Perltidy
currently retains existing one-line blocks but does not form new
one-line blocks, which is something I plan to implement soon.  Another
issue is that it currently looks ahead to check the length of existing
one-line blocks, using the old whitespace, and consequently it sometimes
mistakenly keeps a block which should be broken up.  An example of this
can be seen in the file <STRONG>braces.t</STRONG> in the <EM>test</EM> directory.  A
temporary fix for this problem is to simply run the script through
perltidy a second time.  I'm planning a general fix.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="vertical alignment issues">Vertical Alignment issues</A></H2>
<P>The VerticalAligner package works very well, but every once in a while it
makes a bad decision which, for example, prevents a side comment from
aligning with its neighbors, or leaves some extra white space in the
middle of a line.  These are low priority problems, but it would be nice
to correct them as they are discovered.  One example of this can be seen
in the second section of file <EM>sidecmt.t</EM> in the <EM>test</EM> directory.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="develop a standard set of test scripts">Develop a standard set of test scripts</A></H2>
<P>I've made a small start on this, and plan to add more.  I have an almost
unlimited supply, and the problem is to sift out those that are really
useful.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="documentation">Documentation</A></H2>
<P>There are still a few undocumented options which need to be either
documented or removed from the code.</P>
<P>A FAQ or maybe COOKBOOK needs to be written, to explain some of the
more subtle formatting issues.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="html output">Html output</A></H2>
<P>Since perltidy does an accurate tokenization of input files, it would be
straightforward to add a -html flag to produce html output with syntax
coloring.  I don't have any plans to do this, but could if there is
interest.</P>
