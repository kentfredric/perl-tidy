<h1>An example of finding a nesting error</h1>

If you have ever tried to track down an extra brace or paren in a large
script, you know how difficult it can be.  Perltidy makes it very easy.
To show this, I took the largest Perl script that I could find,
<code>latex2html</code>, and added an extra opening curly brace at a
random place near the middle of the file (line 8046 out of about
16000).  Then I used Perl to check the syntax with <code>perl -c
latex2html</code>.  Perl reported this:
<p></DIV>
<hr>
<pre>
Missing right curly or square bracket at latex2html line 16291, at end of line
syntax error at latex2html line 16291, at EOF
latex2html had compilation errors.
</pre>
<hr>
That's not very useful!  Perl does not even tell us if
the problem is a curly brace or square bracket, and it
gives no indication as to where the problem is.  With no other
tool, one would have to perform a manual binary search
for the problem by running <code>perl -c</code> on
pieces of the code.
<p>
When Perltidy is run on this script with the command
<code>perltidy latex2html</code> it produces an error file
<code>latex2html.ERR</code> with this information:
<hr>
<pre>
Final nesting depth of '{'s is 1
The most recent un-matched '{' is on line 8004
8004: sub extract_captions {
                           ^
</pre>
<hr>
That's much better.  It shows what the problem is, and approximately where.
Since I knew that the indicated <code>{</code> is valid, and should be matched
by the <code>}</code> at the end of that <code>sub</code>, I pointed my editor
(vim) to the closing brace of <code>sub extract_captions</code> and used the
percent key to find the matching, extra brace at line 8046.  It couldn't be
much easier.
<p>
Actually, it can be!  
Perltidy always compares the
indentation spaces in the input file with the indentation implied by its
braces, and reports any differences.  
So if you are as careful as a python programmer to 
keep your file properly indented, for example by running
it through perltidy on a regular basis, this
can pinpoint any brace error immediately.
